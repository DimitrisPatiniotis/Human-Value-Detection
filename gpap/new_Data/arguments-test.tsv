D01089	We should fight crony capitalism in India	in favor of	Crony capitalists are able to get away with just about anything. They enjoy the full support of money and the government in all their endeavors. Their decisions may even cause the economy to suffer adversely.
D01090	We should fight crony capitalism in India	in favor of	Crony capitalists get an advantage over their competitors due to support from the government. Simple examples of the undue advantage they get may be in the form of easier loan sanctions, loan approvals despite adverse credit ratings, easier land acquisition, out-of-turn property registration, tender approvals without any past record of performance, etc. This ruins the reward system of the markets.

Decreased entrepreneurial activity leads to lesser job opportunities and borrowing.
D01091	We should fight crony capitalism in India	in favor of	Crony capitalism has led to India having the world’s worst non-performing loan ratio. Lenders gave away loans to unworthy entities over the years despite knowing their credit backgrounds.

The banks are left with no other option but to take huge haircuts (sometimes even as high as 65%) on the loans recovered. Taxpayers' money is often used to bail out these banks in order to save the economy.

But the same is not true for men. If a man is a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment, there is no single government entity he can approach to.

To address these gender stereotypes and discrimination, there is a need for 'National commission for Men'.

As can be easily seen in India, crimes against women have been on the rise. Most horrific of all, crimes against minor girls have increased drastically since 2012. This paints a very grim picture of our society as a whole. The highest GDP growth rate amounts to nothing if our society itself is corrupted to the extent that it is right now. India has been a patriarchal society for centuries. To make a shift to an egalitarian society for women in every aspect of life, Indian men need to be re-educated and rehabilitated with the new norms.
D01123	There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India	in favor of	Drug addiction is a menace that has plagued Indian youth in recent years.

D01150	We should deal with gender inequality	in favor of	Though our constitution guarantees equal rights to women in all aspects, the mentality of people didn’t change. There have been several cases of rapes, domestic violence, dowry, acid attacks, etc. that led to the formation of several strict laws for women's safety.

D01151	We should deal with gender inequality	in favor of	Women are lagging far behind men in education. Fewer girls attend school as compared to boys and also their dropout rate is high.

D01152	We should deal with gender inequality	in favor of	Though the government and courts are trying to bring equality to society, it has to be the people’s mindset that needs a change.

D01153	We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir	in favor of	As per Article 370, people of other regions cannot buy land or settle in Jammu & Kashmir.

D01154	We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir	in favor of	By abolishing this article, the government can act tough against the terrorism present in the region.
D01155	We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir	in favor of	Many laws such as The prohibition of the Child Marriage Act, and women’s reservations were not applicable to Jammu & Kashmir, because of the provisions of Article 370.

D02006	We should fight against urbanization	in favor of	Due to high demand, land prices, housing prices, and rents will increase drastically. Not everyone can afford the prices.

D02043	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory	in favor of	Initially, India faced issues such as vaccine shortage, lack of availability of vaccines in remote places, etc. But now after solving all these challenges, the main challenge now is to vaccinate those who do not want to be vaccinated. So, by enforcing legal measures such as compulsory vaccination, we can achieve 100% vaccination.

D03029	We should invest in the development of high-speed railways	in favour of	High-Speed Railways (HSR) in India are going to be a new step toward a technologically advanced nation that would help in the development of infrastructure as well as reduce unemployment.
E01010	We should change our consumption habits	in favor of	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior. 
E01011	We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss 	in favor of	Not taking climate impact and biodiversity loss into account makes it difficult for businesses to move towards a more virtuous system. 
E01012	We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss 	in favor of	It is important to take into account all negative consequences in the balance sheet of companies so that everything that is taken/destroyed/polluted from nature is accounted for.
E01016	We should change our consumption habits	in favor of	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste. 
E01017	We should have a CO2 Carbon Equivalent Indicator for every product in the market	against	What does it mean to have a mere CO2eq. indicator? That's utter nonsense as there are many more impact categories.
E01041	We should ban cryptocurrencies	in favor of	e-coins can be easily blocked, erased, or stolen. 
E01042	We should ban cryptocurrencies	in favor of	Cryptocurrencies are causing massive damage to the environment due to large energy consumption.
E01043	We should ban cryptocurrencies	in favor of	all these alternations of Bitcoin are copies of the one Ponzi scheme - you pay for 'fiat' as these e-coins are backed only by the faith of e-believers willing to own it
E01046	We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic	in favor of	Microplastics are everywhere nowadays: in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. It is said that we consume a credit card's worth of plastics every week. This must stop before we consume an apple's worth of plastics every week. 
E01047	We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic	in favor of	Not many consumers are aware of how many of their products contain microplastics because producers deliberately hide this fact by only referring to the chemical names of microplastics on labels. 
E01048	We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic	in favor of	In order to in parallel raise consumer awareness about which products contain microplastics, the EU should introduce a requirement for mandatory labels on packages of products containing microplastics warning consumers of the presence thereof.
E01049	We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic	in favor of	the solution must be a combination of EU regulation of microplastics, producers proactively replacing microplastics with natural elements with the same functions, and consumers making more informed choices to reduce demand from products with microplastics.
E01057	We should ban cryptocurrencies	against	the second EU starts banning cryptocurrencies, it will start getting compared to totalitarian regimes (even more than now).
E01058	We should ban cryptocurrencies	against	everyone should have a right to own cryptocurrency.
E01062	We should change our consumption habits	in favor of	such an approach to be successful must be implemented in each EU country to have visible results and help change the habits of both EU citizens and the private sector. And it has to be long-term promoted and funded. Can we do it?
E01063	We should change our consumption habits	in favor of	Education is key. School curricula could help have more responsible consumption. 
E01064	We should change our consumption habits	in favor of	The national governments with the help of the EU should be able to set up “taxes” or “rewards” as in Sweden or Denmark to encourage citizens to recycle.
E01066	We should give nuclear energy a green label	in favor of	giving nuclear energy a green label will encourage the flow of financial resources across the EU toward environmentally sustainable activities
E01067	We should give nuclear energy a green label	in favor of	Nuclear energy can be considered sustainable because it is cheap and can be predicted for decades, and the price of power produced by nuclear power plants is not affected by changes in the price of natural gas or other energy carriers.
E01068	We should give nuclear energy a green label	in favor of	Nuclear energy use helps to avoid the release of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants every year, which contribute to the development of acid rain, smog, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
E01085	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies	in favor of	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right.
E01086	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies	in favor of	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model. 
E01087	We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network	in favor of	a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network will lower plane traffic
E01088	We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network	in favor of	a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network will create an affordable European travel card to make traveling by train possible for the majority of European citizens.
E01089	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU	in favor of	There is scientific consensus on the fact that fish have the ability to feel pain and emotions such as fear. 
E01090	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU	in favor of	Fishing with live bait creates the risk of introducing and spreading invasive species, as well as the risk of transmitting diseases to wild fish. 
E01095	We should criminalize the export of waste	in favor of	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.
E01096	We should criminalize the export of waste	in favor of	Waste produces negative environmental impacts in the recipient state. 
E01097	We should criminalize the export of waste	in favor of	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife.
E01098	We should criminalize the export of waste	in favor of	Exported trash is often flushed to the sea by rain, thus polluting rivers on the go.
E01122	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	against	It's an empty slogan that doesn't reflect the core principles and true nature of European integration. Member States and their peoples are the basis. 
E01123	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	against	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem. 
E01124	We should create an EU protocol for UAP reports of personnel employed by airlines and personnel of all armed forces for all member states	in favor of	We need to realize the truth of what's out there. Truthful and open research without bias or stigmas.
E01125	We should develop a strategy for the EU defense in relation to NATO	in favor of	I guess that after the recent Russian attack on Ukraine, the idea of the EU defense and the army seems much more feasible and convenient.
E01131	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	in favor of	Less centralization in Brussels, more flexibility.
E01133	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	in favor of	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us. Europe has two kinds of countries: small countries and small countries that haven't realised they are small yet. If we want to protect European sovereignty we need to keep integrating. The other option is to sell our countries to China and Russia or turn them into American colonies. 
E01134	We should ban animals in circuses	in favor of	There is little or no educational, conservational, research, or economic benefit derived from wild animals in traditional circuses that might justify their use and the loss of their ability to behave naturally as wild animals. 
E01135	We should ban animals in circuses	in favor of	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture.
E01136	We should ban animals in circuses	in favor of	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.
E01137	We should ban animals in circuses	in favor of	Circuses are traveling entertainment services moving around Europe, and performing wild animals are transported across Member States, where circuses pose a severe public safety threat.
E01138	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU	in favor of	The broadcasting license on the European level can enable the creation of media champions that will be able to compete with media champions in other parts of the world (CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera...)
E01139	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU	in favor of	The broadcasting license on the European level can project European soft power beyond its borders. 
E01140	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU	in favor of	The broadcasting license on the European level can help avoid misinformation, meddling, and foreign influence more than smaller networks, which would ensure a better quality of the content.
E01141	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU	in favor of	The broadcasting license on the European level will unite European markets for film and music.   
E01144	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries	in favor of	I agree, it would agile bureaucracy and it would benefit both citizens and institutions.
E01145	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries	in favor of	As we are sometimes required to move for work (mobility of workforce) it would be great, if all EU countries accept a language or format of official documents.
E01148	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	against	No Federations, no centralization. We need to respect the European diversity. 
E01149	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	in favor of	A federal republic in which all European peoples can live according to their own way of life and identity. Yes, that would help!
E01150	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	in favor of	We must recognize that in the face of climate change, a refugee crisis, a past financial crisis, and now a pandemic, it is no longer sufficiently well-welcomed to present the interests of Europeans
E01151	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	in favor of	The individual member states are too weak to cope with the major challenges of our time. 
E01153	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	EU needs to take advantage of the high quality of high school education to enable the best young people to develop their talents for the benefit of society.
E01154	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	Research, and in particular open-ended curiosity-driven research, is the essential solid bedrock on which a better and more innovative Europe can be built.
E01155	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	Without increased financing of research, we will lack a firm evidence base.
E01156	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	Without increased financing of research, the industry will miss out on disruptive technologies.
E01157	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	Without increased financing of research, the movement toward better political, social and legal structures will falter.
E01158	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	against	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less.  Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness.
E01160	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	in favor of	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late. You cannot discuss solutions for years, which requires urgent action. 
E01161	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	against	Since the EU was developed, little progress and much stagnation have been made.  
E01162	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation	against	The EURO has been a disaster. It has impoverished the EU and turned the EU into a fighting Union. 
E01164	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	Europe is slipping badly behind in many technological sectors. More investment by both the public and private sectors is needed to solve this problem.
E01165	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	Without decades of basic research to build on, the development of not one but several vaccines against Covid-19 to battle the current pandemic would have been impossible. 
E01166	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	Massive cuts to the research budget are leading to a tremendous brain drain and are destroying Europe as the home of scientific excellence. 
E01167	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	To face future crises – from climate change over cancer to multi-resistant bacteria - we need a strong fundament of open research that will provide the solutions when needed.
E01168	We should end animal abuse	in favor of	Feeding or dressing man is no longer an acceptable excuse with the state of knowledge of the “modern” world.
E01169	We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU	in favor of	A common broadcasting license would have an effect on the EU countries experiencing democratic backsliding
E01170	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	No science means war, hunger, material, and moral poverty.
E02077	We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians	in favor of	All of Europe has to pay income tax & VAT, except for the Eurocrats. In Belgium, you have to pay 50 % of your salary to the state, unless you work directly for the EU. Is this fair? No, of course not! It is time to make Europe fairer in a very practical and direct way, by abolishing tax exemptions for European politicians and staff. 
E02078	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands	in favor of	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections.
E02079	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 	against	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it.  We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control.  I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.
E02080	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 	against	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.
E02081	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 	in favor of	With the ongoing population explosion, in particular in Africa and the ME, the EU has no other option than a total ban on immigration. Exceptions can be made for temporary stays and for experts the EU needs. 
E02082	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 	in favor of	The EU attempts to gain power over the EU members on the distribution of immigrants.  It thereby cuts the rights of the EU members.  
E02083	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 	in favor of	The EU is also weak in dealing with NGOs and in dealing with countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrants.  Indeed, the EU cannot be trusted because of a lack of ambition or lack of competence.
E02084	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 	in favor of	The NGOs are committing the EXACT same crime Lukashenko is guilty of: Organizing mass migration and directing it toward Europe is aggression and an act of hybrid warfare. 
E02085	We should create a European Wealth Fund	against	Creating new funds will only benefit some banks. 
E02086	We should create a European Wealth Fund 	against	Just another pile of debt with more bureau-crazy.  Forget it.
E02087	We should create a European Wealth Fund 	in favor of	Creating a European Wealth Fund will help to foster European growth and unity.
E02088	We should create a European Wealth Fund 	in favor of	A European Wealth Fund should be created to serve as the nexus for strategic investments in European and international economic activity aligning with European fundamental rights, norms, and values and the global green and digital transition.
E02089	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects 	against	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops. 
E02090	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects 	in favor of	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.
E02091	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children	in favor of	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing.  Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight.  Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.
E02092	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe	in favor of	No person should really earn an income from owning land itself, because it is not the result of human labor. Planet Earth is the common inheritance of humanity, why should any human have the right to take a piece of ground and demand payment from someone else for the privilege of using it? The land exists independently of the land owner.
E02093	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe	in favor of	A land tax would eliminate land speculation because the increase in ground rent would go away in tax.
E02094	We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for	in favor of	Having all workers working in private enterprise, irrespective of size, share equity in the company they work for by default would motivate higher worker dedication, overall operating and productive efficiencies, improved quality, profit sharing, reduced corrupt practices in management through stricter accountability, work satisfaction - a win-win situation for all.
E02119	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.
E02120	We should ban wild animals in circuses	in favor of	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!
E03001	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.
E03002	We should ban wild animals in circuses	in favor of	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!
E03021	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	against	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?
E03022	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	against	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see.
E03023	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	against	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.
E03024	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	against	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way.
E03034	We should implement a climate score for products	in favor of	In addition to production and shipping, the score should also reflect the impact of the product's disposal. For example if the product requires to apply many different (toxic) chemicals for recycling, this should result in a worse score. 
E03035	We should implement a climate score for products	in favor of	Yes, but the problem is: Just because a product can be recycled, it does not mean that it always will be recycled. Let's assume that there would be a really climate friendly way to recycle batteries. Still people could throw those into landfills. How does the score deal with this?
E03036	We should build more nuclear power plants	against	Where do you think should be stored nuclear/radioactive waste please? Stored in glaciers will be problem (with melting etc.).
E03043	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	in favor of	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place.
E03044	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	in favor of	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.
E03056	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering	against	I think every region or city has the right to protect the citizens & the environment. If they all have to wait till the whole European Union is following & all existing cars which have been produced & sold under different conditions naturally fade out, they have no chance. 
E03062	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently.
E03075	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy	against	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. It is only transitional. We have good conditions for sustainable green energy (solar, wind, hydro, bio-methane and their combinations).
E03083	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	against	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers. 
E03084	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.
E03085	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm?
E03086	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do.
E03087	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal.
E04003	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	in favor of	Good idea. These camps can be managed by the UN. The EU can send illegal immigrants to these camps. So they will not be on EU soil. From the camps they still can apply for asylum.
E04004	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	in favor of	Europe has signed the UN charta on human rights. Also, Europe has the resources to design a fair and safe migration system so that the death of refugees in the Mediterranean sea stops.
E04005	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Immigrants from non-European countries are also growing old.  
E04006	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments.
E04007	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly.
E04009	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children. 
E04010	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.
E04011	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights. 
E04017	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	in favor of	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.'
E04018	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	against	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork.
E04055	We should have legal migration channels.	against	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell. 
E04056	We should have legal migration channels.	against	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.
E04057	We should have legal migration channels.	against	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language.
E04058	We should end illegal pushbacks.	against	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result. 
E04059	We should end illegal pushbacks.	against	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.
E04060	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.	in favor of	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
E04061	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.	in favor of	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.
E04065	We should end illegal pushbacks.	in favor of	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.
E04068	We should end mass migration together.	in favor of	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.
E04069	We should end mass migration together.	in favor of	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely. 
E04073	We should end illegal pushbacks!	against	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty. 
E04074	We should end illegal pushbacks!	against	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration. 
E04093	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	It has been proven in many studies,  that immigrants will not cost Europe money but enrich our economy, as well as in so many cultural ways. It will not cost Europe more than the profit they ultimately contribute
E04094	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	Refugees want to find a safe place in order to live. People are HUMAN.
E04095	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist?
E04116	We should be aware of migration due to climate change	in favor of	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!  
E04117	We should be aware of migration due to climate change	in favor of	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them.  We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value. 
E04135	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	This single migration policy should include that:  Brussels (EU) handles the paperwork and logistics. Including, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants. 
E04136	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration.
E04150	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work. 
E04159	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	Europeans should retain control of our homeland, just as everyone else should theirs.
E05006	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states	against	'Fair' taxation is a vague concept. Taxes are complex and countries want to avoid double taxation.  Countries should be able to set their own taxes in a way that matches their spending and the needs of their citizens. I am against global taxes and against double taxation.
E05007	We should further develop robotization	in favor of	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life
E05008	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union	in favor of	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.
E05009	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union	in favor of	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research.  This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic.  These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.
E05038	We should abolish the European Council	against	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre. The Commission should be entirely under the control of the sovereign member states, of course, who remain the masters of the treaties.
E05041	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation	against	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.'  The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.
E05057	We should abolish the European Council	in favor of	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way.   The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election. 
E05058	We should abolish the European Council	in favor of	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.
E05065	We should abolish unanimity voting	in favor of	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.
E05075	We should abolish unanimity voting	against	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.
E05077	We should abolish unanimity voting	in favor of	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.
E05078	We should abolish unanimity voting	in favor of	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.
E05086	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees	in favor of	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport. 
E05091	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU	against	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.
E05092	We should create a pan-European train company	in favor of	I think the EU should be in charge of this project, instead of national governments trying to link it up and everything should be financed with the EU budget.
E05093	We should create a pan-European train company	in favor of	A common train network would be a strong alternative to air- and even the car-travel if it is done properly with the right services and prices. For freight, this would significantly reduce truck distances and thus significantly reduce pollution. 
E05095	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry	in favor of	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.
E05100	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems	against	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters.
E05103	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU	in favor of	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people.
E05109	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU	in favor of	This way all EU countries have access to a single database which will reduce paperwork and registration and provide immediate and informed service without the risk of complications, especially in regard to medical history. 
E05110	We should embrace the future of GMO	against	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.
E05114	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU	in favor of	The EU Database should be made accessible for health studies and prevention in order to establish a European Basic Health care industry to overcome future pandemics.
E05117	We should ban domestic air traffic	against	Instead of banning anything, we should create better alternatives. When the high-speed rail line (320 km/h) between Strasbourg and Paris was opened, the number of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped dramatically, due to decreasing demand.
E05123	We should decriminalize drug use	in favor of	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.
E05128	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU	against	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.
E05132	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory	against	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all!  Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world.  Radioactive rain - cool ;-) 
E05134	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees	in favor of	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets. 
E05135	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees	in favor of	If an employee receives part of his salary in the form of car and petrol, he will naturally use it more than he would otherwise, be less inclined to explore alternative ways of transport and opt for a bigger more polluting vehicle than what he really needs.
E05137	We should embrace the future of GMO	in favor of	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.
E05138	We should embrace the future of GMO	in favor of	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.
E05144	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU	against	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.
E05147	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU	against	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly.  Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.
E05149	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees	against	How would you know how many cases where companies and employees rely on their cars? How would you differentiate between needs and luxury?
E05150	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry	against	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this. 
E05151	We should embrace the future of GMO	against	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature.  Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose.  Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).
E05152	We should embrace the future of GMO	against	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.
E05153	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate	in favor of	Unfortunately, vaccination has shown that it is unable to curb the contagion and therefore the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the EU COVID digital certificate is not able to guarantee the safety for which it was designed, demonstrating that it is primarily a tool of discrimination without real usefulness in containing contagion
E06001	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity. 	in favor of	Eurocrats must learn to act within the space afforded them by the European Treaties. Their grandstanding and theatrics are counterproductive
E06002	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity. 	in favor of	To begin with, stop using the labels “Europe” and “European” to name the EU institutions and initiatives. Do not forget that there are parts of the EU that are not part of Europe (the Spanish territories of the Canary Islands and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, for example, belong to Africa from a geographical point of view); also, that there are parts of Europe that do not belong to Europe (the UK and Switzerland, to name only two); the EU and Europe are not synonyms: Cyprus is a member state of the EU, but 'if' geographically it is Europe, so must be Turkey.
E06021	We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses	in favor of	Sexual offences and other serious crimes giving rise to psychological trauma must be excluded from limitation periods, as it is often impossible for victims to remember, let alone report, within the limitation period.
E06034	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law	against	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions. It's impossible, and superfluous to develop a uniform, EU-standard conception of the rule of law. 
E06035	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech	against	'War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength'... and now censorship is free speech.
E06037	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender	against	We have made huge strides in ending sex-based discrimination in Europe. I think we can say that - but for a few details - this issue has been resolved.  'Gender' is a political concept made out of whole cloth. One is certainly free to imagine oneself to be a pink unicorn, but in the eyes of the law and society, he or she remains a man or a woman.
E06051	We should fight racism in the EU	against	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.
E06066	We should create a common constitution	against	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter. 
E06072	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU	in favor of	We need to protect citizen sovereignty against bad players (be it the state, private entities, or other individuals). 
E06073	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU	in favor of	Facial recognition can and will be used against each of us by governments and corporations, based on who we are and what we look like. It will create societies of fear, anxiety, and suspicion.
E06074	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU	in favor of	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against. 
E06080	We should abolish Chatcontrol	in favor of	Yes, child abuse is a terrible crime, but there must be another way, which won't introduce surveillance of all. This surveillance would affect all people and violate their rights to privacy. It could (and probably would) end up abused by hackers, totalitarian regimes, etc. for censorship of free speech.  There is no such thing as a backdoor only for the good guys.
E06081	We should abolish Chatcontrol	in favor of	Chatcontrol is a harmful norm: it violates the secrecy of correspondence, increases the indiscriminate and unreasonable surveillance of citizens, allows governments and providers to experiment with tools that can be used for worrying purposes
E06082	We should abolish Chatcontrol	in favor of	Chatcontrol harms minors as well — it shifts attention to risks online, but abuses occur mainly offline: in families living in poverty and degradation; in the structures that should help them; in EU-funded refugee camps, or in countries with which we have diplomatic relations. 
E06090	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech	against	Who gets to decide what is 'hate speech'? Should the promotion of feminism be considered hate speech against men, or is only hate speech when you don't agree with someone?
E06096	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language	in favor of	Europe should choose a common language.  This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language. 
E07024	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work. 
E07041	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	It has been proven in many studies,  that immigrants will not cost Europe money but enrich our economy, as well as in so many cultural ways. It will not cost Europe more than the profit they ultimately contribute
E07042	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	Refugees want to find a safe place in order to live. People are HUMAN.
E07043	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist?
E07090	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	This single migration policy should include that:  Brussels (EU) handles the paperwork and logistics. Including, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants. 
E07091	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration.
E07097	We should be aware of migration due to climate change	in favor of	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!  
E07098	We should be aware of migration due to climate change	in favor of	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them.  We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value. 
E07127	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	Europeans should retain control of our homeland, just as everyone else should theirs.
E07139	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Immigrants from non-European countries are also growing old.  
E07140	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments.
E07141	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly.
E07146	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.  
E07147	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.
E07148	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights. 
E07155	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world	in favor of	Behavior and habits change slowly when a new direction is pointed out. People become less satisfied with changes the older they get. EU needs time for the goodwill of the people for permanent changes. Then a new EU foreign policy can be established. 
E07156	We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world	in favor of	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order.
E07160	We should establish a European Army.	in favor of	You should endorse the creation of the European Army to defend the interests of European countries, fight against trafficking (humans, drugs, etc.), and be used as the arm of genuine European diplomacy.
E07161	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	in favor of	Europe has signed the UN charta on human rights. Also, Europe has the resources to design a fair and safe migration system so that the death of refugees in the Mediterranean sea stops. 
E07169	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	in favor of	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.'
E07170	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.	in favor of	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution. 
E07171	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.	in favor of	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person. 
E07174	We should end illegal pushbacks!	against	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty. 
E07175	We should end illegal pushbacks!	against	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration. 
E07176	We should establish a Russian interest including EU policy.	in favor of	I think it is extremely important to upgrade our relations with the former Eastern European countries and in that way move us in the right direction. It is now they need us the most. The area around the Black Sea has enormous potential. They have a growth zone that moves from western Europe to the east and at the same time a growth zone that moves from south China to the north.  
E07192	We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.	in favor of	By focusing on the well-being of people, particularly disenfranchised people, the EU can arrive at a more complete and sustainable vision of global peace and prosperity.
E07245	We should have legal migration channels.	against	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell. 
E07246	We should have legal migration channels.	against	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.
E07247	We should have legal migration channels.	against	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language.
E07250	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	against	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork.
E07254	We should end illegal pushbacks.	against	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result. 
E07255	We should end illegal pushbacks.	against	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.
E07266	We should end illegal pushbacks.	in favor of	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.
E07272	We should end mass migration together.	in favor of	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.
E07273	We should end mass migration together.	in favor of	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely. 
E07275	We should consider Russian interests in the EU policy.	in favor of	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop,  With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today. 
E07280	We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements	in favor of	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
E08023	We should abolish covid digital pass	against	You owe the fact that you can drink your coffee in public to the people who got vaccinated and thus made the virus a little more manageable.
