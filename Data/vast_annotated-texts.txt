A1	Once upon a time there was a rich man who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly		
A2	Every morning he was the first one out of bed, and at night the last one to go to bed. Whenever there was a difficult job that nobody wanted to do, he was always the first to volunteer. He never complained at any of this, but was contented with everything and always happy		
A3	He never complained at any of this, but was contented with everything and always happy		
A4	The servant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had done before, and when at the end of this year he again received no wages, he still stayed on without complaining		
A5	When the third year had passed, the master thought it over, then put his hand into his pocket, but pulled out nothing.		
A6	"However, this time the servant said, ""Master, I have served you honestly for three years. Be so good as to give me what by rights I have coming to me. I would like to be on my way and see something else of the world."""		
A7	"""Yes, my good servant,"" answered the old miser, ""you have served me without complaint, and you shall be kindly rewarded."""		
A8	"With this he put his hand into his pocket, then counted out three hellers one at a time, saying, ""There, you have a heller for each year. That is a large and generous reward. Only a few masters would pay you this much."""		
A9	"""Yes, my good servant,"" answered the old miser, ""you have served me without complaint, and you shall be kindly rewarded."" With this he put his hand into his pocket, then counted out three hellers one at a time, saying, ""There, you have a heller for each year. That is a large and generous reward. Only a few masters would pay you this much."""		
A10	"The good servant, who understood little about money, put his wealth into his pocket, and thought, ""Ah, now that I have a full purse, why should I worry and continue to plague myself with hard work?"" So he set forth, uphill and down, singing and jumping for joy."		
A11	"""Why should I be sad?"" answered the servant. ""I have everything I need. Three years' wages are jingling in my pocket."		
A12	"""How much is your treasure?"" the dwarf asked him. ""How much? Three hellers in real money, precisely counted."""		
A13	"Now because the servant had a good heart and felt pity for the dwarf, he gave him his three hellers, saying, ""In God's name, I won't miss them."""		
A14	"Then the dwarf said, ""Because I see that you have a good heart I will grant you three wishes, one for each heller. They shall all be fulfilled."""		
A15	"Soon afterward he met a Jew with a long goatee, who was standing listening to a bird singing high up in the top of a tree. ""One of God's own miracles,"" he shouted, ""that such a small creature should have such a fearfully loud voice. If only it were mine! If only someone would sprinkle some salt on its tail!"" ""If that is all you want,"" said the servant, ""then the bird shall soon be down here."" He took aim, hit it precisely, and the bird fell down into a thorn hedge."		
A16	"""If that is all you want,"" said the servant, ""then the bird shall soon be down here."" He took aim, hit it precisely, and the bird fell down into a thorn hedge. ""Rogue,"" he said to the Jew, ""Go and fetch the bird out for yourself."""		
A17	The Jew's legs immediately began to move, and he jumped up. The more the servant fiddled the better went the dance. However, the thorns ripped apart the Jew's shabby coat, combed his beard, and pricked and pinched him all over his body.		
A18	"""If you are so generous,"" said the servant, ""then I will stop my music. But I must praise the singular way that you dance to it."" Then he took his purse he went on his way."		
A19	As soon as he had thus refreshed himself a little, and caught his breath again, he ran into the town to the judge.		
A20	"""Judge, sir,"" he said, ""Oh, woe is me! See how a godless man has robbed me and abused me on the open road. A stone on the ground would feel sorry for me. My clothes are ripped into shreds. My body is pricked and scratched to pieces. And what little I owned has been taken away with my purse -- genuine ducats, each piece more beautiful than the others. For God's sake, let the man be thrown into prison."""		
A21	"The judge asked, ""Was it a soldier who cut you up like that with his saber?"" ""God forbid,"" said the Jew. ""He didn't have a naked dagger, but rather a blowpipe hanging from his back, and a fiddle from his neck. The scoundrel can easily be recognized."" The judge sent his people out after him. They found the good servant, who had been walking along quite slowly. And they found the purse with the money on him as well."		
A22	"When he was brought before the judge he said, ""I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money. He offered it to me freely, so that I would stop fiddling, because he could not stand my music."" ""God forbid!"" cried the Jew. ""He is reaching for lies like flies on the wall."""		
A23	"The judge did not believe his story, and said, ""That is a poor excuse. No Jew would do that."" And because he had committed robbery on the open road, the good servant was sentenced to the gallows."		
A24	"As he was being led away, the Jew screamed after him, ""You good-for-nothing. You dog of a musician. Now you will receive your well earned reward."""		
A25	"The servant walked quietly up the ladder with the hangman, but on the last rung he turned around and said to the judge, ""Grant me just one request before I die."""		
A26	"But the judge said, ""Why should I not grant him this short pleasure? It has been promised to him, and he shall have it."" In any event, he could not have refused because of the gift that had been bestowed on the servant."		
A27	"""I stole it. I stole it,"" he cried. ""But you have honestly earned it."""		
A28	With that the judge had the Jew led to the gallows and hanged as a thief.		
A29	"The good servant listened to this, then took his fiddle, hung it around his neck again, and climbed down the ladder. He went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground gasping for air, and said, ""You rogue, now confess where you got the money, or I will take my fiddle off my neck and begin to play again."" ""I stole it. I stole it,"" he cried. ""But you have honestly earned it."""		
A30	Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife		
A31	Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other dearly.		
A32	Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other dearly. However, they had no children, though they wished very much to have some, and the woman prayed for them day and night, but they didn't get any, and they didn't get any.		
A33	"""Oh,"" said the woman. She sighed heavily, looked at the blood before her, and was most unhappy. ""If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow."" And as she said that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen."		
A34	And when the sixth month was over, the fruit was thick and large, and then she was quite still. And after the seventh month she picked the juniper berries and ate them greedily.		
A35	Then the fifth month passed, and she stood beneath the juniper tree, which smelled so sweet that her heart jumped for joy, and she fell on her knees and was beside herself. And when the sixth month was over, the fruit was thick and large, and then she was quite still. And after the seventh month she picked the juniper berries and ate them greedily. Then she grew sick and sorrowful.		
A36	"Then the eighth month passed, and she called her husband to her, and cried, and said, ""If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper tree."" Then she was quite comforted and happy until the next month was over, and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she saw it, she was so happy that she died."		
A37	Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree, and he began to cry bitterly. After some time he was more at ease, and although he still cried, he could bear it. And some time later he took another wife.		
A38	When the woman looked at her daughter, she loved her very much, but then she looked at the little boy, and it pierced her heart, for she thought that he would always stand in her way, and she was always thinking how she could get the entire inheritance for her daughter		
A39	When the woman looked at her daughter, she loved her very much, but then she looked at the little boy, and it pierced her heart, for she thought that he would always stand in her way, and she was always thinking how she could get the entire inheritance for her daughter. And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace.		
A40	"One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, when her little daughter came up too, and said, ""Mother, give me an apple."" ""Yes, my child,"" said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest. The chest had a large heavy lid with a large sharp iron lock. ""Mother,"" said the little daughter, ""is brother not to have one too?"" This made the woman angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school."" When from the window she saw him coming, it was as though the Evil One came over her, and she grabbed the apple and took it away from her daughter, saying, ""You shall not have one before your brother."" She threw the apple into the chest, and shut it. Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, ""My son, do you want an apple?"" And she looked at him fiercely. ""Mother,"" said the little boy, ""how angry you look. Yes, give me an apple."" Then it seemed to her as if she had to persuade him. ""Come with me,"" she said, opening the lid of the chest. ""Take out an apple for yourself."" And while the little boy was leaning over, the Evil One prompted her, and crash! she slammed down the lid, and his head flew off, falling among the red apples."		
A41	"One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, when her little daughter came up too, and said, ""Mother, give me an apple."" ""Yes, my child,"" said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest. The chest had a large heavy lid with a large sharp iron lock."		
A42	"""Mother,"" said the little daughter, ""is brother not to have one too?"""		
A43	"This made the woman angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school."" When from the window she saw him coming, it was as though the Evil One came over her, and she grabbed the apple and took it away from her daughter, saying, ""You shall not have one before your brother."""		
A44	"She threw the apple into the chest, and shut it. Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, ""My son, do you want an apple?"" And she looked at him fiercely."		
A45	"Then fear overcame her, and she thought, ""Maybe I can get out of this."" So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white scarf out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen. Then she set him on a chair in front of the door and put the apple in his hand."		
A46	"So Marlene went to him and said, ""Brother, give me the apple."" But he was silent, so she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, ""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted."		
A47	Marlene went to her chest of drawers, took her best silk scarf from the bottom drawer, and gathered all the bones from beneath the table and tied them up in her silk scarf, then carried them outside the door, crying tears of blood.		
A48	Marlene went to her chest of drawers, took her best silk scarf from the bottom drawer, and gathered all the bones from beneath the table and tied them up in her silk scarf, then carried them outside the door, crying tears of blood. She laid them down beneath the juniper tree on the green grass, and after she had put them there, she suddenly felt better and did not cry anymore.		
A49	At the same time a mist seemed to rise from the tree, and in the center of this mist it burned like a fire, and a beautiful bird flew out of the fire singing magnificently, and it flew high into the air, and when it was gone, the juniper tree was just as it had been before, and the cloth with the bones was no longer there.		
A50	My mother, she killed me, My father, he ate me, My sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.		
A51	"""Wife,"" said the man, ""go into the shop. There is a pair of red shoes on the top shelf. Bring them down."" Then the wife went and brought the shoes."		
A52	My mother, she killed me, Then one of them stopped working. My father, he ate me, Then two more stopped working and listened, My sister Marlene, Then four more stopped, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf,		
A53	Laid them beneath		
A54	"""Yes,"" he said, ""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" ""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."" Then the bird came down, and the twenty millers took a beam and lifted the stone up. Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho!"		
A55	He flew far away to a mill, and the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack.		
A56	He flew far away to his father's house.		
A57	"The father said, ""I feel so contented. I am so happy."" ""Not I,"" said the mother, ""I feel uneasy, just as if a bad storm were coming."""		
A58	But Marlene just sat and cried and cried.		
A59	"""Not I,"" said the woman, ""I am so afraid that my teeth are chattering, and I feel like I have fire in my veins."" And she tore open her bodice even more."		
A60	Marlene sat in a corner crying. She held a handkerchief before her eyes and cried until it was wet clear through.		
A61	"With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully. Then the man went in and said, ""Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks."""		
A62	"Then she was contented and happy. She put on the new red shoes and danced and leaped into the house. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I was so sad when I went out and now I am so contented. That is a splendid bird, he has given me a pair of red shoes."""		
A63	And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death. The father and Marlene heard it and went out. Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.		
A64	"""Marlene,"" said the mother, ""what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it."		
A65	At the same time a mist seemed to rise from the tree, and in the center of this mist it burned like a fire, and a beautiful bird flew out of the fire singing magnificently, and it flew high into the air, and when it was gone, the juniper tree was just as it had been before, and the cloth with the bones was no longer there. Marlene, however, was as happy and contented as if her brother were still alive. And she went merrily into the house, sat down at the table, and ate		
A66	Upon which so strange a spectacle, the people of the city gathered apace together upon the sands, to wonder; and so after put themselves into a number of small boats, to go nearer to this marvellous sight.		
A67	and to discern (as far as appertaineth to the generations of men) between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures and illusions of all sorts.		
A68	And forasmuch as we learn in our books that thou never workest miracles, but to divine and excellent end, (for the laws of nature are thine own laws, and thou exceedest them not but upon great cause,) we most humbly beseech thee to prosper this great sign, and to give us the interpretation and use of it in mercy; which thou dost in some part secretly promise by sending it unto us

A99	E qui sta anco un libro in lettere d'oro di cose importantissime.		
A100	E' un Principe Sacerdote tra loro, che s'appella Sole, e in lingua nostra si dice Metafisico: questo è capo di tutti in spirituale e temporale, e tutti li negozi in lui si terminano.		
A101	Potestà		
A102	Sapienza		
A103	Amore		
A104	Il Sapienza ha cura di tutte le scienze e delli dottori e magistrati dell'arti liberali e meccaniche, tiene sotto di sé tanti offiziali quante son le scienze: ci è l'Astrologo, il Cosmografo, il Geometra, il Loico, il Rettorico, il Grammatico, il Medico, il Fisico, il Politico, il Morale; e tiene un libro solo, dove stan tutte le scienze, che fa leggere a tutto il popolo ad usanza di Pitagorici. E questo ha fatto pingere in tutte le muraglie, su li rivellini, dentro e di fuori, tutte le scienze.		
A105	Nelle mura del tempio esteriori e nelle cortine, che si calano quando si predica per non perdersi la voce, vi sta ogni stella ordinatamente con tre versi per una.  Nelle mura del primo girone tutte le figure matematiche, più che non scrisse Euclide ed Archimede, con la lor proposizione significante. Nel di fuore, vi è la carta della terra tutta, e poi le tavole d'ogni provinzia con li riti e costumi e leggi loro, e con l'alfabeti ordinari sopra il loro alfabeto.  Nel dentro del secondo girone vi son tutte le pietre preziose e non preziose, e minerali, e metalli veri e pinti, con le dichiarazioni di due versi per uno. Nel di fuore vi son tutte sorti di laghi, mari e fiumi, vini ed ogli ed altri liquori, e loro virtù ed origini e qualità; e ci son le caraffe piene di diversi liquori di cento e trecento anni, con li quali sanano tutte l'infirmità quasi.  Nel dentro del terzo vi son tutte le sorti di erbe ed arbori del mondo pinte, e pur in teste di terra sopra il rivellino e le dichiarazioni dove prima si ritrovaro, e le virtù loro, e le simiglianze c'hanno con le stelle e con li metalli e con le membra umane, e l'uso loro in medicina. Nel di fuora tutte maniere di pesci di fiumi, laghi e mari, e le virtù loro, e 'l modo di vivere, di generarsi e allevarsi, a che serveno; e le simiglianze c'hanno con le cose celesti e terrestri e dell'arte e della natura; sì che mi stupii, quando trovai pesce vescovo e catena e chiodo e stella, appunto come son queste cose tra noi. Ci sono ancini, rizzi, spondoli e tutto quanto è degno di sapere con mirabil arte di pittura e di scrittura che dichiara.  Nel quarto, dentro vi son tutte sorti di augelli pinti e lor qualità, grandezze e costumi, e la fenice è verissima appresso loro. Nel di fuora stanno tutte sorti di animali rettili, serpi, draghi, vermini, e l'insetti, mosche, tafani ecc., con le loro condizioni, veneni e virtuti; e son più che non pensamo.  Nel quinto, dentro vi son l'animali perfetti terrestri di tante sorti che è stupore. Non sappiamo noi la millesima parte, e però, sendo grandi di corpo, l'han pinti ancora nel fuore rivellino; e quante maniere di cavalli solamente, o belle figure dichiarate dottamente!  Nel sesto, dentro vi sono tutte l'arti meccaniche, e l'inventori loro, e li diversi modi, come s'usano in diverse regioni del mondo. Nel di fuori vi son tutti l'inventori delle leggi e delle scienze e dell'armi. Trovai Moisè, Osiri, Giove, Mercurio, Macometto ed altri assai; e in luoco assai onorato era Gesù Cristo e li dodici Apostoli, che ne tengono gran conto, Cesare, Alessandro, Pirro e tutti li Romani; onde io ammirato come sapeano quelle istorie, mi mostraro che essi teneano di tutte nazioni lingua, e che mandavano apposta per il mondo ambasciatori, e s'informavano del bene e del male di tutti; e godeno assai in questo. Viddi che nella China le bombarde e le stampe furo prima ch'a noi. Ci son poi li maestri di queste cose; e li figliuoli, senza fastidio, giocando, si trovano saper tutte le scienze istoricamente prima che abbin dieci anni.		
A106	Questa è una gente ch'arrivò là dall'Indie, ed erano molti filosofi, che fuggiro la rovina di Mogori e d'altri predoni e tiranni; onde si risolsero di vivere alla filosofica in commune, si ben la communità delle donne non si usa tra le genti della provinzia loro; ma essi l'usano, ed è questo il modo. Tutte cose son communi; ma stan in man di offiziali le dispense, onde non solo il vitto, ma le scienze e onori e spassi son communi, ma in maniera che non si può appropriare cosa alcuna.  Dicono essi che tutta la proprietà nasce da far casa appartata, e figli e moglie propria, onde nasce l'amor proprio; ché per sublimar a ricchezze o a dignità il figlio o lasciarlo erede, ognuno diventa o rapace publico, se non ha timore, sendo potente; o avaro ed insidioso ed ippocrita, si è impotente. Ma quando perdono l'amor proprio, resta il commune solo.

Ma quando perdono l'amor proprio, resta il commune solo.		
A108	E credo che li preti e monaci nostri, se non avessero li parenti e li amici, o l'ambizione di crescere più a dignità, seriano più spropriati e santi e caritativi con tutti.		
A109	tra loro non possono donarsi cosa alcuna, perché tutto hanno del commune, e molto guardano gli offiziali, che nullo abbia più che merita. Però quanto è bisogno tutti l'hanno. E l'amico si conosce tra loro nelle guerre, nell'infirmità, nelle scienze, dove s'aiutano e s'insegnano l'un l'altro. E tutti li gioveni s'appellan frati e quei che son quindici anni più di loro, padri, e quindici meno figli. E poi vi stanno l'offiziali a tutte cose attenti, che nullo possa all'altro far torto nella fratellanza.		
A110	Di quante virtù noi abbiamo, essi hanno l'offiziale: ci è un che si chiama Liberalità, un Magnanimità, un Castità, un Fortezza, un Giustizia, criminale e civile, un Solerzia, un Verità, Beneficienza, Gratitudine, Misericordia, ecc.; e a ciascuno di questi si elegge quello, che da fanciullo nelle scole si conosce inclinato a tal virtù. E però, non sendo tra loro latrocini, né assassinii, né stupri ed incesti, adultèri, delli quali noi ci accusamo, essi si accusano d'ingratitudine, di malignità, quando un non vuol far piacere onesto, di bugia, che abborriscono più che la peste; e di questi rei per pena son privati della mensa commune, o del commerzio delle donne, e d'alcuni onori, finché pare al giudice, per ammendarli.

A115	di questi rei per pena son privati della mensa commune, o del commerzio delle donne, e d'alcuni onori, finché pare al giudice, per ammendarli.		
A116	E s'allevan tutti in tutte l'arti.		
A117	Però non può essere Sole se non quello che sa tutte l'istorie delle genti e riti e sacrifizi e republiche ed inventori di leggi ed arti. Poi bisogna che sappia tutte l'arti meccaniche, perché ogni due giorni se n'impara una, ma l'uso qui le fa saper tutte, e la pittura. E tutte le scienze ha da sapere, matematiche, fisiche, astrologiche. Delle lingue non si cura, perché ha l'interpreti, che son i grammatici loro. Ma più di tutti bisogna che sia Metafisico e Teologo, che sappia ben la radice e prova d'ogni arte e scienza, e le similitudini e differenze delle cose, la Necessità, il Fato, e l'Armonia del mondo, la Possanza, Sapienza e Amor divino e d'ogni cosa, e li gradi degli enti e corrispondenze loro con le cose celesti, terrestri e marine, e studia molto bene nei Profeti ed astrologia. Dunque si sa chi ha da esser Sole, e se non passa trentacinque anni, non arriva a tal grado; e questo offizio è perpetuo, mentre non si trova chi sappia più di lui e sia più atto al governo.		
A118	non può saper governare chi attende alle scienze.		
A119	Poi son l'arti communi agli uomini e donne, le speculative e meccaniche;		
A120	ad ogni officio soprastante è un vecchio ed una vecchia, che comandano ed han potestà di battere o far battere da altri li negligenti e disobedienti, e notano ognuno ed ognuna in che esercizio meglio riesce.

A124	li medici hanno cura di dire alli cochi in quel giorno, qual sorte di vivanda conviene, e quale alli vecchi e quale alli giovani e quale all'ammalati.		
A125	Gli offiziali hanno la miglior parte; questi mandano spesso della loro a tavola a chi più si ha fatto onore la mattina nelle lezioni e dispute di scienze ed armi, e questo si stima per grande onore e favore.		
A126	Hanno in tutte le piazze delli gironi le lor fontane, che tirano l'acque dal fondo solo con muover un legno, onde esse spicciano per li canali.		
A127	Negli atri di fuora son orologi di sole e di squille per tutti i gironi, e banderuole per saper i venti.		
A128	quando perdono l'amor proprio, resta il commune solo.		
A129	Ma il nostro Sole sia pur tristo in governo, non sarà mai crudele, né scelerato, né tiranno un chi tanto sa.		
A130	al che ci vol sol memoria servile, onde l'uomo si fa inerte, perché non contempla le cose ma li libri, e s'avvilisce l'anima in quelle cose morte;		
A131	Il che non può avvenire al nostro Sole, perché non può arrivare a tante scienze chi non è scaltro d'ingegno ad ogni cosa, onde è sempre attivissimo al governo.		
A132	Ma tutti questi offiziali han d'essere filosofi, e più, ed istorici, naturalisti ed umanisti.		
A133	Nulla femina si sottopone al maschio, se non arriva a dicinov'anni né maschio si mette alla generazione inanti alli vintiuno, e più si è di complessione bianco.

A137	la generazione è osservata religiosamente per ben pubblico, non privato		
A138	s'uno s'innamora di qualche donna, è lecito tra loro parlare, far versi, scherzi, imprese di fiori e di piante.

A143	non tengono schiavi, perché essi bastano a se stessi, anzi soverchiano.		
A144	Però la communità tutti li fa ricchi e poveri		
A145	poveri, perché non s'attaccano a servire alle cose, ma ogni cosa serve a loro.		
A146	non tengono schiavi,

A151	vi son quattro regni nell'isola, li quali han grande invidia della felicità loro, perché li popoli desiderariano vivere come questi Solari, e vorriano star più soggetti ad essi, che non a' propri regi. Onde spesso loro è mossa guerra, sotto color d'usurpar confini e di viver empiamente, perché non sequeno le superstizioni di Gentili, né dell'altri Bragmani; e spesso li fan guerra, come ribelli che prima erano soggetti. E con tutto questo perdono sempre.		
A152	costui dimanda a' nemici che rendano il tolto o lascino la tirannia; e se quelli negano, li bandiscono la guerra., chiamando Dio delle vendette a testimonio contra di chi ha il torto; e si quelli prolungano il negozio, non li danno tempo, si è re, più d'un ora, si è republica, tre ore a deliberar la risposta, per non esser burlati; e così si piglia la guerra, se quelli son contumaci alla ragione.		
A153	Si propone in Consiglio grande, dove entra tutto il popolo di venti anni in su, e le donne ancora		
A154	Nell'assalti, chi prima saglie il muro ha dopo in onore una corona di gramigna con applauso militare delle donne e fanciulli. Chi aiuta il compagno ha la corona civica di quercia; chi uccide il tiranno, le spoglie opime, che porta al tempio, e si dona al Sole il cognome dell'impresa.		
A155	Ci son poi li trionfi militari ad uso di Romani, e più belli, e le supplicazioni ringraziatorie. E si presenta al tempio il capitano, e si narrano li gesti dal poeta o istorico ch'andò con lui. E 'l Principe lo corona, ed a tutti soldati fa qualche regalo ed onore, e per molti dì sono esenti dalle fatiche publiche.		
A156	Ma essi l'hanno a male, perché non sanno stare oziosi ed aiutano gli altri.		
A157	Chi non aiutò l'amico o fe' atto vile, è frustato; chi fu disobediente, si mette a morire dentro a un palco di bestie con un bastone in mano, e se vince i leoni e l'orsi, che è quasi impossibile, torna in grazia.		
A158	Perdonano volentieri a' nemici e dopo la vittoria li fanno bene. Se gettano mura o vogliono occider i capi o altro danno a' vinti, tutto fanno in un giorno, e poi li fanno bene, e dicono che non si deve far guerra se non per far gli uomini buoni, non per estinguerli.		
A159	Bella cosa per non fomentar fazioni a roina della patria e schifar le guerre civili, onde nasce il tiranno,		
A160	Le speculative son di tutti,		
A161	Non vogliono che schiavi o forastieri infettino la città di mali costumi; però vendono quelli che pigliano in guerra, o li mettono a cavar fosse o far esercizi faticosi fuor della città, dove sempre vanno quattro squadre di soldati a guardare il territorio e quelli che lavorano, uscendo dalle quattro porte, le quali hanno le strade di mattoni fin al mare per condotta delle robbe e facilità delli forastieri.		
A162	L'agricoltura è in gran stima: non ci è palmo di terra che non frutti. Osservano li venti e le stelle propizie, ed escono tutti in campo armati ad arare, seminare, zappare, metere, raccogliere, vindemmiare, con musiche, trombe e stendardi; ed ogni cosa fanno tra pochissime ore. Hanno le carra a vela, che caminano con il vento, e quando non ci è vento, una bestia tira un gran carro, bella cosa, ed han li guardiani del territorio armati, che per li campi sempre van girando. Poco usano letame all'orti ed a' campi, dicendo che li semi diventano putridi e fan vita breve, come le donne imbellettate e non belle per esercizio fanno prole fiacca. Onde né pur la terra imbellettano, ma ben l'esercitano, ed hanno gran secreti di far nascer presto e multiplicare, e non perder seme. E tengon un libro a posta di tal esercizio, che si chiama la Georgica. Una parte del territorio, quanto basta, si ara; l'altra serve per pascolo delle bestie. Or questa nobil arte di far cavalli, bovi, pecore, cani ed ogni sorte d'animali domestici è in sommo pregio appresso loro, come fu in tempo antico d'Abramo; e con modi magici li fanno venire al coito, che possan ben generare, inanzi a cavalli pinti o bovi o pecore; e non lasciano andar in campagna li stalloni con le giumente, ma li donano a tempo opportuno inanzi alle stalle di campagna. Osservano Sagittario in ascendente, con buono aspetto di Marte e Giove: per li bovi, Tauro, per le pecore, Ariete, secondo l'arte. Hanno poi mandre di galline sotto le Pleiadi e papare e anatre, guidate a pascere dalle donne con gusto loro presso alla città e li luochi, dove la sera son serrate a far il cascio e latticini, butiri e simili. Molto attendono a' caponi ed a' castrati ed al frutto, e ci è un libro di quest'arte detto la Bucolica.		
A163	Gran cosa, che le donne ed uomini sempre vanno in squadroni, né mai soli, e sempre all'obedienza del capo si trovano senza nullo disgusto; e ciò perché l'hanno come padre o frate maggiore.		
A164	ognuno desidera esser primo alla fatica per la docilità delli costumi e per esser poca e fruttuosa		
A165	A nullo fan torto; senza esser stimolati non combattono.		
A166	navigano per conoscer genti e paesi.		
A167	Dicono che il mondo averà da riducersi a vivere come essi fanno, però cercano sempre sapere se altri vivono meglio di loro.		
A168	Hanno anche gran secreti di fuochi artifiziali per le guerre marine e terrestri, e stratagemme, che mai non restan di vincere.		
A169	Essi dicono che prima bisogna mirar la vita del tutto e poi delle parti;		
A170	Segno d'ingegno grande,		
A171	Ogni nove luna ed ogni opposizione sua fanno Consiglio dopo il sacrifizio; e qui entrano tutti di venti anni in suso, e si dimanda ad ognuno che cosa manca alla città, e chi offiziale è buono e chi è tristo.		
A172	si ragiona di quel che bisogna al publico, e si eleggon gli offiziali, pria nominati in Consiglio grande. Dopo ogni dì fa consiglio Sole e li tre Principi delle cose occorrenti, e confirmano e conciano quel che si è trattato nell'elezione e gli altri bisogni. Non usano sorti, se non quando son dubbi in modo che non sanno a qual parte pendere. Questi offiziali si mutano secondo la volontà del popolo inchina, ma li quattro primi no, se non quando essi stessi, per consiglio fatto tra loro, cedono a chi veggono saper più di loro, ed aver più purgato ingegno; e son tanto docili e buoni, che volentieri cedeno a chi più sa ed imparano da quelli; ma questo è di rado assai.		
A173	Questi offiziali si mutano secondo la volontà del popolo inchina,		
A174	Or qui hai da sapere che ognun è giudicato da quello dell'arte sua; talché ogni capo dell'arte è giudice, e punisce d'esilio, di frusta, di vituperio, di non mangiar in mensa commune, di non andar in chiesa, non parlar alle donne. Ma quando occorre caso ingiurioso, l'omicidio si punisce con morte, ed occhio per occhio, naso per naso si paga la pena della pariglia, quando è caso pensato. Quando è rissa subitanea, si mitiga la sentenza, ma non dal giudice, perché condanna subito secondo la legge, ma dalli tre Principi. E s'appella pure al Metafisico per grazia, non per giustizia, e quello può far la grazia. Non tengono carceri, se non per qualche ribello nemico un torrione. Non si scrive processo, ma in presenza del giudice e del Potestà si dice il pro e il contra; e subito si condanna dal giudice; e poi dal Potestà, se s'appella, il sequente dì si condanna; e poi dal Sole il terzo dì si condanna, o s'aggrazia dopo molti dì con consenso del popolo. E nessuno può morire, se tutto il popolo a man comune non l'uccide; ché boia non hanno, ma tutti lo lapidano o brugiano, facendo che esso s'elegga la polvere per morir subito. E tutti piangono e pregano Dio, che plachi l'ira sua, dolendosi che sian venuti a resecare un membro infetto dal corpo della republica; e fanno di modo che esso stesso accetti la sentenza, e disputano con lui fin tanto che esso, convinto, dica che la merita; ma quando è cosa contra la libertà o contra Dio, o contra gli offiziali maggiori, senza misericordia si esequisce. Questi soli si puniscono con morte; e quel che more ha da dire tutte le cause perché non deve morire, e li peccati degli altri e dell'offiziali, dicendo quelli meritano peggio; e se vince, lo mandano in esilio e purgano la città con preghiere e sacrifizi ed ammende; ma non però travagliano li nominati.		
A175	quando occorre caso ingiurioso, l'omicidio si punisce con morte, ed occhio per occhio, naso per naso si paga la pena della pariglia,		
A176	s'appella pure al Metafisico per grazia, non per giustizia, e quello può far la grazia.		
A177	Non si scrive processo, ma in presenza del giudice e del Potestà si dice il pro e il contra; e subito si condanna dal giudice; e poi dal Potestà, se s'appella, il sequente dì si condanna; e poi dal Sole il terzo dì si condanna, o s'aggrazia dopo molti dì con consenso del popolo.		
A178	Si guardano assai dalla calunnia per non patir la medesima pena.		
A179	"Le leggi son pochissime, tutte scritte in una tavola di rame alla porta del tempio, cioè nelle colonne, nelle quali ci son scritte tutte le quiddità delle cose in breve: che cosa è Dio, che cosa è angelo, che cosa è mondo, stella, uomo, ecc., con gran sale, e d'ogni virtù la diffinizione. E li giudici d'ogni virtù hanno la sedia in quel loco, quando giudicano, e dicono: ""Ecco, tu peccasti contra questa diffinizione: leggi""; e così poi lo condanna o d'ingratitudine o di pigrizia o d'ignoranza; e le condanne son certe vere medicine, più che pene, e di soavità grande."		
A180	Tengono per cosa certa l'immortalità dell'anima, e che s'accompagni, morendo, con spiriti buoni o rei, secondo il merito. Ma li luoghi delle pene e premi non l'han tanto per certi; ma assai ragionevole pare che sia il cielo e i luochi sotterranei.		
A181	tutti gli offiziali son sacerdoti, parlando delli capi, ed offizio loro è purgar le conscienze.		
A182	Talché tutti si confessano a quelli, ed essi imparano che sorti di peccati regnano.		
A183	Il sacrifizio è questo, che dimanda al popolo chi si vol sacrificare per gli suoi membri, e così un di quelli più buoni si sacrifica.		
A184	Dopo mangiare si rendon grazie a Dio con musica, e poi si cantano gesti di eroi cristiani, ebrei, gentili, di tutte nazioni, per spasso e per godere. Si cantano inni d'amore e di sapienza e virtù. Si piglia ognuno quella che più ama, e fanno alcuni balli sotto li chiostri, bellissimi. Le donne portano li capelli lunghi, inghirlandati ed uniti in un groppo in mezzo la testa con una treccia. Gli uomini solo un cerro, un velo e berrettino. Usano cappelli in campagna, in casa berrette bianche o rosse o varie, secondo l'offizio ed arte che fanno, e gli officiali più grandi e pompose.		
A185	fanno gran rappresentazioni belle e dotte;		
A186	E nelli giorni che fondaro la città e quando ebbero vittoria, fanno il medesimo con musica di voci feminine e con trombe e tamburi ed artiglierie; e li poeti cantano le laudi delli più virtuosi. Ma chi dice bugia in laude è punito; non si può dir poeta chi finge menzogna tra loro; e questa licenza dicono che è ruina del mondo, che toglie il premio alle virtù e lo dona altrui per paura o adulazione.		
A187	chi dice bugia in laude è punito;		
A188	Ma chi dice bugia in laude è punito; non si può dir poeta chi finge menzogna tra loro; e questa licenza dicono che è ruina del mondo, che toglie il premio alle virtù e lo dona altrui per paura o adulazione.		
A189	Non si fa statua a nullo, se non dopo che more; ma, vivendo, si scrive nel libro delli eroi chi ha trovato arti nove o secreti d'importanza, o fatto gran benefizio in guerra o pace al publico.  Non si atterrano li corpi morti, ma si bruggiano per levar la peste e per convertirsi in fuoco, cosa tanto nobile e viva, che vien dal sole ed a lui torna, e per non restar sospetto d'idolatria. Restano pitture solo o statue di grand'uomini, e quelle che mirano le donne formose, che s'applicano all'uso della razza.		
A190	Laudano Tolomeo ed ammirano Copernico, benché Aristarco e Filolao prima di lui; ma dicono che l'uno fa il conto con le pietre, l'altro con le fave, ma nullo con le stesse cose contate, e pagano il mondo con li scudi di conto, non d'oro.		
A191	Però essi cercano assai sottilmente questo negozio, perché importa a saper la fabbrica del mondo, e se perirà e quando, e la sostanza delle stelle e chi ci sta dentro a loro.		
A192	dicono che l'uno fa il conto con le pietre, l'altro con le fave, ma nullo con le stesse cose contate, e pagano il mondo con li scudi di conto, non d'oro.		
A193	Son nemici d'Aristotile, l'appellano pedante.		
A194	Negano gli eccentrici ed epicicli di Tolomeo e di Copernico;		
A195	Talché in settembre bisogna dire che sia stato fatto il mondo, come gli Ebrei e Caldei antiqui, non li moderni, escogitaro:		
A196	Stanno anche molto curiosi		
A197	non conosceno le persone distinte e nominate al modo nostro, perché non ebbero revelazione, ma sanno ch'in Dio ci è processione e relazione di sé a sé;		
A198	Essi confessano che nel mondo ci sia gran corruttela, e che gli uomini si reggono follemente e non con ragione;		
A199	chiamano infelicità quella loro, perché è annichilirsi il mostrarsi quel che non sei, cioè d'esser re, d'essere buono, d'esser savio, e non esser in verità.		
A200	dicono che la pena e la colpa redonda alla città, tanto de' figli, quanto de' padri;		
A201	è forzato a confessare la providenza di Dio ad alta voce.		
A202	"""Quel che non vuoi per te non far ad altri, e quel che vuoi per te fa' tu il medesimo."""		
A203	Quelli vanno per avarizia di danari cercando nuovi paesi, ma Dio intende più alto fine.		
A204	Oh, se sapessi che cosa dicono per astrologia e per l'istessi profeti nostri ed ebrei e d'altre genti di questo secolo nostro, c'ha più storia in cento anni che non ebbe il mondo in quattro mila; e più libri si fecero in questi cento che in cinque mila: e dell'invenzioni stupende della calamita e stampe ed archibugi, gran segni dell'union del mondo; e come, stando nella triplicità quarta l'asside di Mercurio a tempo che le congiunzioni magne si faceano in Cancro, fece queste cose inventare per la Luna e Marte, che in quel segno valeno al navigar novo, novi regni e nove armi. Ma entrando l'asside di Saturno in Capricorno, e di Mercurio in Sagittario, e di Marte in Vergine, e le congiunzioni magne tornando alla triplicità prima dopo l'apparizion della stella nova in Cassiopea, sarà grande monarchia nova, e di leggi riforma e d'arti, e profeti e rinovazione. E dicono che a' cristiani questo apporterà grand'utile; ma prima si svelle e monda, poi s'edifica e pianta.		
A205	Questo sappi, c'han trovato l'arte del volare, che sola manca al mondo, ed aspettano un occhiale di veder le stelle occulte ed un oricchiale d'udir l'armonia delli moti di pianeti.		
A206	aspettano un occhiale di veder le stelle occulte		
A207	"Essi dicono che la femina apporta fecondità di cose in cielo, e virtù manco gagliarda rispetto a noi aver dominio. Onde si vede che in questo secolo regnaro le donne, come l'Amazoni tra la Nubbia e 'l Monopotapa, e tra gli Europei la Rossa in Turchia, la Bona in Polonia, Maria in Ongheria, Elisabetta in Inghilterra, Catarina in Francia, Margherita in Fiandra, la Bianca in Toscana, Maria in Scozia, Camilla in Roma ed Isabella in Spagna, inventrice del mondo novo. E 'l poeta di questo secolo incominciò dalle donne dicendo: ""Le donne, i cavalier, l'armi e l'amori."" E tutti son maledici li poeti d'ogge per Marte; e per Venere e per la Luna parlano di bardascismo e puttanesmo. E gli uomini si effemminano e si chiamano ""Vossignoria""; ed in Africa, dove regna Cancro, oltre l'Amazoni, ci sono in Fez e Marocco li bordelli degli effeminati publici, e mille sporchezze."		
A208	Questo si sappi, che essi tengon la libertà dell'arbitrio.		
A209	chi segue più il senso che la ragione è soggetto a loro.		
A210	le stelle nelli sensuali inchinano a quella, nelli razionali alla vera legge santa della prima Raggione, sempre laudanda.		
A211	Dimmi, di grazia, tutto quello che t'avvenne in questa navigazione.		
A212	il modo del governo,		
A213	un gran squadrone d'uomini e donne armate,		
A214	come si governa?		
A215	E' la città distinta in sette gironi grandissimi, nominati dalli sette pianeti, e s'entra dall'uno all'altro per quattro strade e per quattro porte, alli quattro angoli del mondo spettanti;		
A216	la porta Tramontana, di ferro coperta, fatta che s'alza e cala con bello ingegno,		
A217	stupendo artifizio.		
A218	Sopra l'altare non vi è altro ch'un mappamondo assai grande, dove tutto il cielo è dipinto, ed un altro dove è la terra. Poi sul cielo della cupola vi stanno tutte le stelle maggiori del cielo, notati coi nomi loro e virtù, c'hanno sopra le cose terrene, con tre versi per una; ci sono i poli e i circoli signati non del tutto, perché manca il muro a basso, ma si vedono finiti in corrispondenza alli globbi dell'altare. Vi sono sempre accese sette lampade nominate dalli sette pianeti.		
A219	Ci sono ancini, rizzi, spondoli e tutto quanto è degno di sapere con mirabil arte di pittura e di scrittura che dichiara.		
A220	Il Metafisico tratta tutti questi negozi con loro, ché senza lui nulla si fa, ed ogni cosa la communicano essi quattro, e dove il Metafisico inchina, son d'accordo.		
A221	si è republica o monarchia o stato di pochi.		
A222	si risolsero di vivere alla filosofica in commune,		
A223	Tutte cose son communi; ma stan in man di offiziali le dispense, onde non solo il vitto, ma le scienze e onori e spassi son communi, ma in maniera che non si può appropriare cosa alcuna.		
A224	Dunque nullo vorrà fatigare, mentre aspetta che l'altro fatighi,		
A225	gli uomini e le donne vestono d'un modo atto a guerreggiare,		
A226	li fanciulli imparano la lingua e l'alfabeto nelle mura,		
A227	Dopo li sette anni vanno alle lezioni delle scienze naturali, tutti;		
A228	Poi tutti si mettono alle matematiche, medicine ed altre scienze,		
A229	Ed in campagna, nei lavori e nella pastura delle bestie pur vanno a imparare; e quello è tenuto di più gran nobiltà, che più arti impara, e meglio le fa.		
A230	con questa distinzione, che quelle dove ci va fatica grande e viaggio, le fan gli uomini, come arare, seminare, cogliere i frutti, pascer le pecore, operar nell'aia, nella vendemmia. Ma nel formar il cascio e mungere si soleno le donne mandare, e nell'orti vicini alla città per erbe e servizi facili. Universalmente, le arti che si fanno sedendo e stando, per lo più son delle donne, come tessere, cuscire, tagliar i capelli e le barbe, la speziaria, fare tutte le sorti di vestimenti; altro che l'arte del ferraro e delle armi. Pur chi è atta a pingere, non se le vieta. La musica è solo delle donne, perché più dilettano, e de' fanciulli, ma non di trombe e tamburi. Fanno anche le vivande; apparecchiano le mense; ma il servire a tavola è proprio delli gioveni, maschi e femine, finché sono di vint'anni.		
A231	Hanno in ogni girone le publiche cucine e le dispense della robba.		
A232	Tutta la gioventù serve alli vecchi che passano quarant'anni; ma il mastro o maestra han cura la sera, quando vanno a dormire, e la mattina di mandar alli servizi di quelli a chi tocca, uno o due ad ogni stanza, ed essi gioveni si servono tra loro, e chi ricusa, guai a lui!		
A233	Si dona a ciascuno, secondo il suo esercizio, piatto di pitanza e menestra, frutti, cascio;		
A234	E nelle feste fanno cantar una musica pur in tavola;		
A235	stimano assai la nettezza nelle strade, nelle stanze e nelli vasi e nelle vestimenta e nella persona.		
A236	Se si trovano in sodomia, sono vituperati,		
A237	Se si trovano in sodomia, sono vituperati, e li fan portare due giorni legata al collo una scarpa, significando che pervertiro l'ordine e posero li piedi in testa, e la seconda volta crescen la pena finché diventa capitale.		
A238	Ma chi si astiene fin a ventun anno d'ogni coito è celebrato con alcuni onori e canzoni.		
A239	celebrato con alcuni onori e canzoni.		
A240	hanno belle statue di uomini illustri, dove le donne mirano.		
A241	Questa ora è determinata dall'Astrologo e Medico;		
A242	si forzan sempre di pigliar tempo, che Mercurio e Venere siano orientali dal Sole in casa benigna e che sian mirati da Giove di buono aspetto e da Saturno e Marte. E così il Sole come la Luna, che spesso sono afete. E per lo più vogliono Vergine in ascendente; ma assai si guardano che Saturno e Marte non stiano in angolo, perché tutti quattro angoli con opposizioni e quadrati infettano, e da essi angoli è la radice della virtù vitale e della sorte, dependente dall'armonia del tutto con le parti. Non si curano del satellizio, ma solo degli aspetti buoni. Ma il satellizio solo nella fondazione della città e della legge ricercano, che però non abbia prencipe Marte o Saturno, se non con buone disposizioni.		
A243	è bisogno stare al detto dell'offiziali.		
A244	Onde agli eroi ed eroisse la republica fa certi doni, in tavola o in feste publiche, di ghirlande o di vestimenta belle fregiate;		
A245	molta gente guastano tenendoli in servitù e povertà,		
A246	o fandoli partecipi di lor vizi, talché manca il servizio publico, e non si può il campo, la milizia e l'arti fare, se non male e con stento.		
A247	a povertà grande fa gli uomini vili, astuti, ladri, insidiosi, fuorasciti, bugiardi, testimoni falsi;		
A248	le ricchezze insolenti, superbi, ignoranti, traditori, disamorati, presumitori di quel che non sanno.		
A249	ricchi, ch'ogni cosa hanno e possedono;		
A250	quella delle donne communi pare dura e ardua. S. Clemente Romano dice che le donne pur sian communi, ma la glosa intende quanto all'ossequio, non al letto, e Tertulliano consente alla glosa; ché i Cristiani antichi tutto ebbero commune, altro che le mogli, ma queste pur furo communi nell'ossequio.		
A251	vanno spiando di tutte nazioni l'usanze, e sempre migliorano;		
A252	dell'arti

A255	talché manca il servizio publico, e non si può il campo, la milizia e l'arti fare, se non male e con stento.		
A256	quei che per loro colpa han perduto, si ricevono con vituperio, e chi fu il primo a fuggire non può scampar la morte, se non quando tutto l'esercito domanda in grazia la sua vita, ed ognuno piglia parte della pena.		
A257	se non quando tutto l'esercito domanda in grazia la sua vita,		
A258	ed ognuno piglia parte della pena.		
A259	Le città superate o date a loro subito mettono ogni avere in commune, e riceveno gli offiziali solari e la guardia, e si van sempre acconciando all'uso della Città del Sole, maestra loro; e mandano li figli ad imparare in quella, senza contribuire a spese.		
A260	son eletti da bambini secondo l'inclinazione e costellazione vista nella genitura loro.		
A261	lo girone il dì le femine, la notte li maschi guardano;		
A262	Usano le cacce per imagini di guerra, e li giochi in piazza a cavallo e a piede ogni festa, e poi segue la musica.		
A263	Perdonano volentieri a' nemici e dopo la vittoria li fanno bene.		
A264	Se tra loro ci è qualche gara d'ingiuria o d'altro, perché essi non contendono se non di onore, il Principe ed i suoi offiziali puniscono il reo secretamente, s'incorse ad ingiuria di fatto dopo le prime ire; se di parole, aspettano in guerra a diffinirle, dicendo che l'ira si deve sfogare contra l'inimici.		
A265	si dichiara la giustizia dell'impresa dal Predicatore,		
A266	E se sono in campo aperto, serrano le bagaglie in mezzo e l'artellerie, e combattono gran pezzo, e poi fan ritirata. E 'l nemico, credendo che cedano, s'inganna; perché essi fanno ala, pigliano fiato e lasciano l'artiglierie sparare, e poi tornano alla zuffa contra nemici scompigliati.		
A267	Ma nelle cose del giusto ci son le pene; però in duello di mano non ponno venire, e chi vuol mostrarsi megliore, faccilo in guerra publica.		
A268	nella natività loro si vede l'inclinazione, e tra loro, per lo compartimento delle fatiche, nullo viene a participar fatica destruttiva dell'individuo, ma solo conservativa.		
A269	Hanno pur un secreto di rinovar la vita ogni sette anni, senza afflizione, con bell'arte.		
A270	non escono di regola.		
A271	è tenuto a vergogna che uno si vegga sputare, dicendo che questo nasce da poco esercizio, da poltroneria o da mangiar ingordo.		
A272	Li capi principali delle scienze son soggetti al Sapienza, altri che il Metafisico che è esso Sole, che a tutte le scienze comanda, come architetto, ed ha vergogna ignorare cosa alcuna al mondo umano. Sotto a lui sta il Grammatico, il Logico, il Fisico, il Medico, il Politico, l'Economico, il Morale, l'Astronomo, l'Astrologo, il Geometra, il Cosmografo, il Musico, il Prospettivo, l'Aritmetico, il Poeta, l'Oratore, il Pittore, il Scultore. Sotto Amore, sta il Genitario, l'Educatore, il Vestiario, l'Agricola, l'Armentario, il Pastore, il Cicurario, il Gran Coquinario. Sotto Podestà il Stratagemmario, il Ferrario, l'Armario, l'Argentario, il Monetario, l'Ingegnero, Mastro spia, Mastro cavallerizzo, il Gladiatore, l'Artegliero, il Frombolario, il Giustiziero. E tutti questi han li particolari artefici soggetti.		
A273	Li falli di fragilità e d'ignoranza si puniscono solo con vituperi, e con farlo imparare a contenersi, e quell'arte in cui peccò, o altra, e si trattano in modo, che paiono l'un membro dell'altro.

A317	An earring round may well a zodiac be, Wherein a sun goes round, which we don’t see;		
A318	And he stand still, as learnèd men would prove;		
A319	There governors do rule, and kings do reign,                   And battles fought, where many may be slain.		
A320	An earring round may well a zodiac be, Wherein a sun goes round, which we don’t see; And planets seven about that sun may move, And he stand still, as learnèd men would prove; And fixed stars like twinkling diamonds, placed                About this earring, which a world is, vast. That same which doth the earring hold, the hole, Is that we call the North and Southern Pole; There nipping frosts may be, and winters cold, Yet never on the lady’s ear take hold.                                    And lightning, thunder, and great winds may blow Within this earring, yet the ear not know. Fish there may swim in seas, which ebb and flow, And islands be, wherein do spices grow; There crystal rocks hang dangling at each ear,                  And golden mines as jewels may they wear. There earthquakes be, which mountains vast down fling, And yet ne’er stir the lady’s ear, nor ring. There meadows be, and pastures fresh and green, And cattle feed, and yet be never seen,                                And gardens fresh, and birds which sweetly sing, Although we hear them not in an earring. There night and day, and heat and cold, and so May life and death, and young and old still grow. Thus youth may spring, and several ages die;                    Great plagues may be, and no infections nigh. There cities be, and stately houses built, Their inside gay, and finely may be gilt. There churches be, wherein priests teach and sing, And steeples too, yet hear the bells not ring.                      From thence may pious tears to Heaven run, And yet the ear not know which way they’re gone. There markets be, where things are bought and sold, Though th’ear knows not the price their markets hold. There governors do rule, and kings do reign,                   And battles fought, where many may be slain. And all within the compass of this ring, Whence they no tidings to the wearer bring. Within the ring, wise counsellors may sit, And yet the ear not one wise word may get.                       There may be dancing all night at a ball, And yet the ear be not disturbed at all. There rivals duels fight, where some are slain; There lovers mourn, yet hear them not complain. And Death may dig a lover’s grave: thus were                    A lover dead in a fair lady’s ear. But when the ring is broke, the world is done; Then lovers they into Elysium run.		
A321	And he stand still, as learnèd men would prove		
A322	if they cannot endure to be Subjects, they may create Worlds of their own, and Govern themselves as they please.		
A323	But, by reason most Ladies take no delight in Philosophical Arguments, I separated some from the mentioned Observations, and caused them to go out by themselves, that I might express my Respects, in presenting to Them such Fancies as my Contemplations did afford.		
A324	I am not Covetous, but as Ambitious as ever any of my Sex was, is, or can be; which is the cause, That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth, or Charles the Second; yet, I will endeavour to be, Margaret the First: and, though I have neither Power, Time nor Occasion, to be a great Conqueror, like Alexander, or Cesar; yet, rather than not be Mistress of a World, since Fortune and the Fates would give me none, I have made One of my own. And thus, believing, or, at least, hoping, that no Creature can, or will, Envy me for this World of mine,		
A325	The Lady now finding her self in so strange a place, and amongst such wonderful kind of Creatures, was extreamly strucken with fear, and could entertain no other Thoughts, but that every moment her life was to be a sacrifice to their cruelty; but those Bear-like Creatures, how terrible soever they appear'd to her sight, yet were they so far from exercising any cruelty upon her, that rather they shewed her all civility and kindness imaginable;		
A326	they left her to the custody of the Females, who entertained her with all kindness and respect, and gave her such victuals as they used to eat;		
A327	men like Foxes, onely walking in an upright shape, who received their neighbours the Bear-men with great civility and Courtship,		
A328	Very good Navigators they were; and though they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile observations, and great practice;		
A329	Besides, they were excellent Augurers, which skill they counted more necessary and beneficial then the use of Compasses, Cards, Watches, and the like;		
A330	they had an extraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers, and that was a certain Engin, which would draw in a great quantity of Air, and shoot forth Wind with a great force; this Engine in a calm, they placed behind their Ships, and in a storm, before; for it served against the raging waves, like Cannons against an hostile Army, or besieged Town; it would batter and beat the waves in pieces, were they as high as Steeples; and as soon as a breach was made, they forced their passage through, in spight even of the most furious wind, using two of those Engins at every Ship, one before, to beat off the waves, and another behind to drive it on; so that the artificial wind had the better of the natural; for, it had a greater advantage of the waves, then the natural of the Ships: the natural being above the face of the Water, could not without a down right motion enter or press into the Ships; whereas the artificial with a sideward-motion, did pierce into the bowels of the Waves: Moreover, it is to be observed, that in a great Tempest they would join their Ships in battel-aray: and when they feared Wind and Waves would be too strong for them, if they divided their Ships; they joined as many together as the compass or advantage of the places of the Liquid Element would give them leave. For, their Ships were so ingeniously contrived, that they could fasten them together as close as a Honey-comb, without waste of place; and being thus united, no Wind nor Waves were able to separate them.		
A331	Novelty discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in peace and tranquillity.		
A332	there was but one language in all that World: nor no more but one Emperor, to whom they all submitted with the greatest duty and obedience, which made them live in a continued Peace and Happiness; not acquainted with Foreign Wars or Home-bred Insurrections.		
A333	of these several sorts of men, each followed such a profession as was most proper for the nature of their Species, which the Empress encouraged them in, especially those that had applied themselves to the study of several Arts and Sciences; for they were as ingenious and witty in the invention of profitable and useful Arts, as we are in our world, nay, more; and to that end she erected Schools, and founded several Societies. The Bear-men were to be her Experimental Philosophers, the Bird-men her Astronomers, the Fly- Worm- and Fish-men her Natural Philosophers, the Ape-men her Chymists, the Satyrs her Galenick Physicians, the Fox-men her Politicians, the Spider- and Lice-men her Mathematicians, the Jackdaw- Magpie- and Parrot-men her Orators and Logicians, the Gyants her Architects, &c.		
A334	Of the States men she enquired, first, Why they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last brake out into open Wars.		
A335	as it was natural for one Body to have but one Head, so it was also natural for a Politick body to have but one Governor; and that a Common-wealth, which had many Governors was like a Monster with many Heads.		
A336	Monarchy is a divine form of Government, and agrees most with our Religion: For as there is but one God, whom we all unanimously worship and adore with one Faith; so we are resolved to have but one Emperor, to whom we all submit with one obedience.		
A337	we are resolved to have but one Emperor, to whom we all submit with one obedience.		
A338	there was no more but one Religion in all that World, nor no diversity of opinions in that same Religion for though there were several sorts of men, yet had they all but one opinion concerning the Worship and Adoration of God.		
A339	Truly, replied the Empress, I thought you had been either Jews, or Turks, because I never perceived any Women in your Congregations: But what is the reason, you bar them from your religious Assemblies? It is not fit, said they, that Men and Women should be promiscuously together in time of Religious Worship; for their company hinders Devotion, and makes many, instead of praying to God, direct their Devotion to their Mistresses. But, asked the Empress, Have they no Congregation of their own, to perform the duties of Divine Worship, as well as Men? No, answered they: but they stay at home, and say their Prayers by themselves in their Closets. Then the Empress desir'd to know the reason why the Priests and Governors of their World were made Eunuchs? They answer'd, To keep them from Marriage: For Women and Children most commonly make disturbance both in Church and State. But, said she, Women and Children have no Employment in Church or State. 'Tis true, answer'd they; but, although they are not admitted to publick Employments, yet are they so prevalent with their Husbands and Parents, that many times by their importunate perswasions, they cause as much, nay, more mischief secretly, then if they had the management of publick Affairs.		
A340	The Empress was very well satisfied with their answers; and after some time, when she thought that her new founded societies of the Vertuoso's had made a good progress in the several Employments she had put them upon, she caused a Convocation		
A341	Concerning the heat of the Sun, they were not of one opinion; some would have the Sun hot in it self, alledging an old Tradition, that it should at some time break asunder, and burn the Heavens, and consume this world into hot Embers, which, said they, could not be done, if the Sun were not fiery of it self. Others again said, This opinion could not stand with reason; for Fire being a destroyer of all things, the Sun-Stone after this manner would burn up all the near adjoining Bodies: Besides, said they, Fire cannot subsist without fuel; and the Sun-Stone having nothing to feed on, would in a short time consume it self; wherefore they thought it more probable that the Sun was not actually hot, but onely by the reflection of its light; so that its heat was an effect of its light, both being immaterial. But this opinion again was laught at by others, and rejected as ridiculous,		
A342	Then the Empress asked them the reason, Why the Sun and Moon did often appear in different postures or shapes, as sometimes magnified, sometimes diminished; sometimes elevated, otherwhiles depressed; now thrown to the right, and then to the left? To which some of the Bird-men answered, That it proceeded from the various degrees of heat and cold, which are found in the Air, from whence did follow a differing density and rarity; and likewise from the vapours that are interposed, whereof those that ascend are higher and less dense then the ambient air, but those which descend are heavier and more dense. But others did with more probability affirm, that it was nothing else but the various patterns of the Air; for like as Painters do not copy out one and the same original just alike at all times; so, said they, do several parts of the Air make different patterns of the luminous Bodies of the Sun and Moon: which patterns, as several copies, the sensitive motions do figure out in the substance of our eyes.		
A343	For Nature is so full of variety, that our weak Senses cannot perceive all the various sorts of her Creatures; neither is there any one object perceptible by all our Senses, no more then several objects are by one sense. I believe you, replied the Empress;		
A344	This observation amazed the Empress very much; for she had hitherto believed, That Snow was made by cold motions, and not by such an agitation or beating of a fiery extract upon water: Nor could she be perswaded to believe it until the Fish- or Mear-men had delivered their observation upon the making of Ice, which, they said, was not produced, as some hitherto conceived, by the motion of the Air, raking the Superficies of the Earth, but by some strong saline vapour arising out of the Seas, which condensed Water into Ice; and the more quantity there was of that vapour, the greater were the Mountains of Precipices of Ice; but the reason that it did not so much freeze in the Torrid Zone, or under the Ecliptick, as near or under the Poles, was, that this vapour in those places being drawn up by the Sun-beams into the middle Region of the Air, was onely condensed into Water, and fell down in showres of Rain; when as, under the Poles, the heat of the Sun being not so vehement, the same vapour had no force or power to rise so high, and therefore caused so much Ice, by ascending and acting onely upon the surface of water.		
A345	This observation amazed the Empress very much; for she had hitherto believed, That Snow was made by cold motions, and not by such an agitation or beating of a fiery extract upon water: Nor could she be perswaded to believe it until the Fish- or Mear-men had delivered their observation upon the making of Ice,		
A346	This Relation confirmed partly the observation of the Bird-men concerning the cause of Snow;		
A347	to avoid hereafter tedious disputes, and have the truth of the Phænomena's of Cœlestial Bodies more exactly known, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers, to observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which they did according to her Majesties Command;		
A348	but these Telescopes caused more differences and divisions amongst them, then ever they had before;		
A349	the Empress began to grow angry at their Telescopes, that they could give no better Intelligence; for, said she, now I do plainly perceive, that your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses;		
A350	the Empress began to grow angry at their Telescopes, that they could give no better Intelligence; for, said she, now I do plainly perceive, that your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses; Wherefore I Command you to break them, and let the Bird-men trust onely to their natural eyes, and examine Cœlestial Objects by the motions of their own Sense and Reason.		
A351	if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth;		
A352	if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth; Wherefore I command you again to break them; for you may observe the progressive motions of Cœlestial Bodies with your natural eyes better then through Artificial Glasses.		
A353	for, said they, we take more delight in Artificial delusions, then in Natural truths. Besides, we shall want Imployments for our Senses, and Subjects for Arguments; for, were there nothing but truth, and no falshood, there would be no occasion to dispute, and by this means we should want the aim and pleasure of our endeavors in confuting and contradicting each other; neither would one man be thought wiser then another, but all would either be alike knowing and wise, or all would be fools;		
A354	The Empress at last consented to their request, but upon condition, that their disputes and quarrels should remain within their Schools, and cause no factions or disturbances in State, or Government.		
A355	To which the Emperess replied, That they might be glassie Pearls, and yet not Eyes; and that perhaps their Microscopes did not truly inform them. But they smilingly answered her Majesty, That she did not know the vertue of those Microscopes: for they never delude, but rectifie and inform the Senses; nay, the World, said they, would be but blind without them, as it has been in former ages before those Microscopes were invented.		
A356	After this, they took a Charcoal, and viewing it with one of their best Microscopes, discovered in it an infinite multitude of pores, some bigger, some less; so close and thick, that they left but very little space betwixt them to be filled with a solid body; and to give her Imperial Majesty a better assurance thereof, they counted in a line of them an inch long, no less then 2700 pores; from which Observation they drew this following Conclusion, to wit, That this multitude of pores was the cause of the blackness of the Coal;		
A357	this was very remarkable and worthy to be taken notice of, that notwithstanding their great skil, industry and ingenuity in Experimental Philosophy, they could yet by no means contrive such Glasses, by the help of which they could spy out a Vacuum, with all its dimensions, nor Immaterial substances, Non-beings, and Mixt-beings, or such as are between something and nothing; which they were very much troubled at, hoping that yet, in time, by long study and practice, they might perhaps attain to it.		
A358	Then she asked both the Fish- and Worm-men, whether all those Creatures that have blood, had a circulation of blood in their veins and arteries? But they answered, That it was impossible to give her Majesty an exact account thereof, by reason the circulation of blood was an interior motion, which their senses, neither of themselves, nor by the help of any Optick Instrument could perceive;		
A359	Truly, answered they, Your Majesty puts a very hard question to us, and we shall hardly be able to give a satisfactory answer to it; for there are many different sorts of Creatures, which as they have all different perceptions, so they have also different organs, which our senses are not able to discover, onely in an Oystershell we have with admiration observed, that the common sensorium of the Oyster lies just as the closing of the shells, where the pressure and re-action may be perceived by the opening and shutting of the shells every tide.		
A360	This Relation confirmed the Empress in the opinion concerning the motion of the Earth, and the fixedness of the Sun, as the Bird-men had informed her;		
A361	I perceive, replyed the Empress, that your judgments are very irregular, since you believe that Gold, which is so fixt a Metal, that nothing has been found as yet which could occasion a dissolution of its interior figure, may be made by Art, and not Tin, Lead, Iron, Copper or Silver, which yet are so far weaker, and meaner Metals then Gold is.		
A362	the Worm-men excused themselves, that they were ignorant in that Art, and that such questions belonged more properly to the Ape-men, which were Her Majesties Chymists.		
A363	Then the Empress asked them, Whether by their Sensitive perceptions they could observe the interior corporeal, figurative Motions both of Vegetables and Minerals? They answer'd, That their Senses could perceive them after they were produced, but not before; Nevertheless, said they, although the interior, figurative motions of Natural Creatures are not subject to the exterior, animal, sensitive perceptions, yet by their Rational perception they may judg of them, and of their productions if they be regular:		
A364	our Glasses do onely represent exterior objects, according to the various reflections and positions of light; and wheresoever light is wanting, the glasses wil do no good.		
A365	After this, and several other Conferences, which the Empress held with the Worm-men, she dismissed them; and having taken much satisfaction in several of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and Observations.		
A366	They begun first with a long and tedious Discourse concerning the Primitive Ingredients of Natural bodies; and how, by their Art, they had found out the principles out of which they consist. But they did not all agree in their opinions;		
A367	But after a great many debates and contentions about this Subject, the Empress being so much tired that she was not able to hear them any longer, imposed a general silence upon them, and then declared her self in this following Discourse.		
A368	I am too sensible of the pains you have taken in the Art of Chymistry, to discover the Principles of Natural Bodies, and wish they had been more profitably bestowed upon some other, then such experiments; for both by my own Contemplation, and the Observations which I have made by my rational & sensitive perception upon Nature, and her works, I find, that Nature is but one Infinite Self-moving Body, which by the vertue of its self-motion, is divided into Infinite parts, which parts being restless, undergo perpetual changes and transmutations by their infinite compositions and divisions.		
A369	if this be so, as surely, according to regular Sense and Reason, it appears no otherwise; it is in vain to look for primary Ingredients, or constitutive principles of Natural Bodies, since there is no more but one Universal Principle of Nature,		
A370	I will not have you to take more pains, and waste your time in such fruitless attempts, but be wiser hereafter, and busie your selves with such Experiments as may be beneficial to the publick.		
A371	The Empress having thus declared her mind to the Ape-men, and given them better Instructions then perhaps they expected, not knowing that her Majesty had such great and able judgment in Natural Philosophy, had several conferences with them concerning Chymical Preperations,		
A372	she knew that Nature's Works are so various and wonderful, that no particular Creature is able to trace her ways.		
A373	Then the Empress commanded her Anatomists to dissect such kinds of Creatures as are called Monsters. But they answered her Majesty, That it would be but an unprofitable and useless work, and hinder their better imployments; for when we dissect dead Animals, said they, it is for no other end, but to observe what defects and distempers they had, that we may cure the like in living ones, so that all our care and industry concerns onely the preservation of Mankind; but we hope your Majesty will not preserve Monsters, which are most commonly destroyed, except it be for novelty: Neither will the dissection of Monsters prevent the errors of Nature's irregular actions; for by dissecting some, we cannot prevent the production of others; so that our pains and labour will be to no purpose, unless to satisfie the vain curiosities of inquisitive men. The Empress replied, That such dissections would be very beneficial to Experimental Philosophers. If Experimental Philosophers, answer'd they, do spend their time in such useless Inspections, they waste it in vain, and have nothing but their labour for their pains.		
A374	The Mathematicians were in great esteem with the Empress, as being not onely the chief Tutors and Instructors in many Arts, but some of them excellent Magicians and Informers of spirits, which was the reason their Characters were so abstruse and intricate, that the Emperess knew not what to make of them. There is so much to learn in your Art, said she, that I can neither spare time from other affairs to busie my self in your profession;		
A375	Then came the Lice-men, and endeavoured to measure all things to a hairs-breadth, and weigh them to an Atom; but their weights would seldom agree, especially in the weighing of Air, which they found a task impossible to be done; at which the Empress began to be displeased, and told them, that there was neither Truth nor Justice in their Profession; and so dissolved their society.		
A376	one of the Parrot-men rose with great formality, and endeavoured to make an Eloquent Speech before her Majesty; but before he had half ended, his arguments and divisions being so many, that they caused a great confusion in his brain, he could not go forward, but was forced to retire backward, with great disgrace both to himself, and the whole society; and although one of his brethren endeavoured to second him by another speech, yet was he as far to seek, as the former. At which the Empress appear'd not a little troubled, and told them, That they followed too much the Rules of Art, and confounded themselves with too nice formalities and distinctions; but since I know, said she, that you are a people who have naturally voluble tongues, and good memories; I desire you to consider more the subject you speak of, then your artificial periods, connexions and parts of speech, and leave the rest to your natural Eloquence; which they did, and so became very eminent Orators.		
A377	I have enough, said she, of your chopt Logick, and will hear no more of your Syllogisms; for it disorders my Reason, and puts my Brain on the rack; your formal argumentations are able to spoil all natural wit; and I'le have you to consider, that Art does not make Reason, but Reason makes Art; and therefore as much as Reason is above Art, so much is a natural rational discourse to be preferred before an artificial:		
A378	your Art of Logick, which consists onely in contradicting each other, in making sophismes, and obscuring Truth, instead of clearing it.		
A379	But they replied to her Majesty, That the knowledg of Nature, that is, Natural Philosophy, would be imperfect without the Art of Logick; and that there was an improbable Truth which could no otherwise be found out then by the Art of disputing.		
A380	Truly, said the Empress, I do believe that it is with Natural Philosophy, as it is with all other effects of Nature; for no particular knowledg can be perfect, by reason knowledg is dividable, as well as composable; nay, to speak properly, Nature her self cannot boast of any perfection, but God himself; because there are so many irregular motions in Nature, and 'tis but a folly to think that Art should be able to regulate them, since Art it self is, for the most part, irregular.		
A381	I do no ways approve of your Profession; and though I will not dissolve your society, yet I shall never take delight in hearing you any more; wherefore confine your disputations to your Schools, lest besides the Commonwealth of Learning, they disturb also Divinity and Policy, Religion and Laws, and by that means draw an utter ruine and destruction both upon Church and State.		
A382	she resolved to build Churches, and make also up a Congregation of Women, whereof she intended to be the head her self, and to instruct them in the several points of her Religion. This she had no sooner begun, but the Women, which generally had quick wits, subtile conceptions, clear understandings, and solid judgments, became, in a short time, very devout and zealous Sisters;		
A383	the Women, which generally had quick wits, subtile conceptions, clear understandings, and solid judgments, became, in a short time, very devout and zealous Sisters;		
A384	she resolved to build Churches, and make also up a Congregation of Women, whereof she intended to be the head her self, and to instruct them in the several points of her Religion.		
A385	And thus the Empress, by Art, and her own Ingenuity, did not onely convert the Blazing-World to her own Religion, but kept them in a constant belief, without inforcement or blood-shed; for she knew well, that belief was a thing not to be forced or pressed upon the people, but to be instilled into their minds by gentle perswasions; and after this manner she encouraged them also in all other duties and employments: for Fear, though it makes people obey, yet does it not last so long, nor is it so sure a means to keep them to their duties, as Love.		
A386	But, said the Empress, Is there not Divine Reason, as well as there is Natural? No, answered they: for there is but a Divine Faith, and as for Reason it is onely Natural; but you Mortals are so puzled about this Divine Faith, and Natural Reason, that you do not know well how to distinguish them, but confound them both, which is the cause you have so many divine Philosophers who make a Gallimafry both of Reason and Faith.		
A387	Then she asked them, Whether Divine Faith was made out of Reason? No answered they, for Faith proceeds onely from a Divine saving Grace, which is a peculiar Gift of God. How comes it then, replied she, that Men, even those that are of several opinions, have Faith more or less? A Natural Belief, answered they, is not a Divine Faith. But, proceeded the Empress, How are you sure that God cannot be known? The several Opinions you Mortals have of God, answered they, are sufficient witnesses thereof.		
A388	she asked again, Whether our Fore-fathers had been as wise, as Men were at present, and had understood sense and reason, as well as they did now? They answered, That in former Ages they had been as wise as they are in this present, nay, wiser; for, said they, many in this age do think their Fore-fathers have been Fools, by which they prove themselves to be such.		
A389	Then she inquired, Whether there was no mystery in Numbers? No other mystery, answered the Spirits, but reckoning or counting; for Numbers are onely marks of remembrance. But what do you think of the Number of Four, said she, which Cabbalists make such ado withal, and of the Number of Ten, when they say that Ten is all, and that all Numbers are virtually comprehended in Four? We think, answered they, that Cabbalists have nothing else to do but to trouble their heads with such useless Fancies;		
A390	It is the nature of Mankind to be inquisitive. Natural desire of knowledg, answered the Spirits, is not blameable, so you do not go beyond what your Natural Reason can comprehend.		
A391	It is the nature of Mankind to be inquisitive. Natural desire of knowledg,		
A392	Then, said she, I'le have the Soul of one of the most famous modern Writers, as either of Galileo, Gassendus, Des Cartes, Helmont, Hobbes, H. More, &c. The Spirits answered, That they were fine ingenious Writers, but yet so self-conceited, that they would scorn to be Scribes to a Woman. But, said they, there's a Lady, the Duchess of Newcastle; which although she is not one of the most learned, eloquent, witty and ingenious, yet she is a plain and rational Writer; for the principle of her Writings, is Sense and Reason, and she will without question, be ready to do you all the service she can. That Lady then, said the Empress, will I chuse for my Scribe,		
A393	The Duchess answered, If your Majesty will be pleased to hearken to my advice, I would desire you to let that work alone; for it will be of no advantage either to you, or your people,		
A394	Wherefore the best way, said she, is to believe with the generality the literal sense of the Scripture, and not to make interpretations every one according to his own fancy, but to leave that work for the Learned, or those that have nothing else to do;		
A395	The Duchess told her, That, Sense and Reason would instruct her of a Nature as much as could be known; and as for Numbers, they were infinite; but to add non-sense to infinite, would breed a confusion, especially in Humane Understanding.		
A396	The Duchess answered, That the chief and onely ground in Government, was but Reward and Punishment, and required no further Cabbala;		
A397	Conquerers seldom enjoy their conquest, for they being more feared then loved, most commonly come to an untimely end.		
A398	At last, when the Duchess saw that no patterns would do her any good in the framing of her World; she was resolved to make a World of her own Invention, and this World was composed of sensitive and rational self-moving Matter; indeed, it was composed onely of the Rational, which is the subtilest and purest degree of Matter; for as the Sensitive did move and act both to the perceptions and consistency of the body, so this degree of Matter at the same point of time (for though the degrees are mixt, yet the several parts may move several ways at one time) did move to the Creation of the Imaginary World;		
A399	The Empress being thus perswaded by the Duchess to make an imaginary World of her own, followed her advice; and after she had quite finished it, and framed all kinds of Creatures proper and useful for it, strengthened it with good Laws, and beautified it with Arts and Sciences; having nothing else to do, unless she did dissolve her Imaginary World, or made some alterations in the Blazing-World, she lived in;		
A400	it was governed without secret and deceiving Policy; neither was there any ambitious, factions, malicious detractions, civil dissentions, or home-bred quarrels, divisions in Religion, Foreign Wars, &c. but all the people lived in a peaceful society, united Tranquility, and Religious Conformity.		
A401	the World she came from, was very much disturbed with Factions, Divisions and Wars;		
A402	nor is there any other mystery in Numbers, but what Man's fancy makes;		
A403	Then the Empress asked, Whether the number of six was a symbole of Matrimony, as being made up of Male and Femal, for two into three is six. If any number can be a symbole of Matrimony, answered the Spirits, it is not Six, but Two; if two may be allowed to be a Number: for the act of Matrimony is made up of two joined in one. she asked again, What they said to the number of Seven? whether it was not an Embleme of God, because Cabbalists say, That it is neither begotten, nor begets any other Number? There can be no Embleme of God, answered the Spirits; for if we do not know what God is, how can we make an Embleme of him? Nor is there any Number in God, for God is the perfection Himself; but Numbers are imperfect; and as for the begetting of numbers, it is done by Multiplication and Addition; but Substraction is as a kind of death to Numbers. If there be no mystery in Numbers, replied the Empress then it is in vain to refer to the Creation of the World to certain Numbers, as Cabbalists do.		
A404	Many, both of your modern and ancient Philosophers, answered the Spirits, endeavour to go beyond Sense and Reason, which makes them commit absurdities; for no corporeal Creature can go beyond Sense and Reason;		
A405	for all there were so many several Nations, Governments, Laws, Religions, Opinions, &c. they should all yet so generally agree in being Ambitious, Proud, Self-conceited, Vain, Prodigal, Deceitful, Envious, Malicious, Unjust, Revengeful, Irreligious, Factious, &c. she did also admire, that not any particular State, Kingdom or Common-wealth, was contented with their own shares, but endeavoured to encroach upon their Neighbours, and that their greatest glory was in Plunder and Slaughter, and yet their victory's less then their expences, and their losses more than their gains; but their being overcome, in a manner their utter ruine:		
A406	the Duchess pray'd the Empress to pardon her that she was of another mind; for, said she, he cannot alter Mahomets Laws and Religion; so that the Law and Church do govern the Emperor, and not the Emperor them.		
A407	coming into the Metropolitan City, the Empress's Soul observed many Gallants go into an House; and enquiring of the Duchess's Soul, what House that was? she told her, It was one of the Theatres where Comedies and Tragedies were acted. The Empress asked, Whether they were real? No, said the Duchess, they are feigned. Then the Empress desired to enter into the Theatre; and when she had seen the Play that was asked, the Duchess asked her how she liked that Recreation? I like it very well, said the Empress; but I observe that the Actors make a better show than the Spectators; and the Scenes a better than the Actors and the Musick and Dancing is more pleasant and acceptable than the Play it self; for I see, the Scenes stand for Wit, the Dancing for Humour, and the Musick is the Chorus. I am sorry, replied the Duchess, to hear your Majesty say so; for if the Wits of this part of the World should hear you, they would condemn you. What, said the Empress, would they condemn me for preferring a natural Face before a Sign-post; or a natural Humour before an artificial Dance; or Musick before a true and profitable Relation? As for Relation, replied the Duchess, our Poets defie and condemn it into a Chimney-corner, fitter for old Womens Tales, than Theatres. Why, said the Empress do not your Poets Actions comply with their Judgments? For their Plays are composed of old Stories, either of Greek or Roman, or some new-found World.		
A408	to get an Impartial Judg, is a thing so difficult, that I doubt we shall hardly find one; for there is none to be had, neither in Nature, nor in Hell, but onely from Heaven;		
A409	his Duke who complains or exclaims so much against me, hath been always my enemy; for he has preferred Honesty and Prudence before me, and slighted all my favours; nay, not onely thus, but he did fight against me, and preferred his Innocence before my Power. His Friends Honesty and Prudence, said he most scornfully, are more to be regarded, than Inconstant Fortune, who is onely a friend to Fools and Knaves; for which neglect and scorn, whether I have not just reason to be his enemy, your Majesty may judg your self.		
A410	Noble Friends, I think it fit, by your leave, to answer Lady Fortune in the behalf of my Noble Lord and Husband, since he is not here himself; and since you have heard her complaint concerning the choice my Lord made of his Friends, and the neglect and disrespect he seemed to cast upon her; give me leave to answer, that, first concerning the Choice of his Friends, He has proved himself a wise man in it; and as for the disrespect and rudeness her Ladiship accuses him of, I dare say he is so much a Gentleman, that I am confident he would never slight, scorn or disrespect any of the Female Sex in all his life time; but was such a servant and Champion for them, that he ventured Life and Estate in their service;		
A411	as for the disrespect and rudeness her Ladiship accuses him of, I dare say he is so much a Gentleman, that I am confident he would never slight, scorn or disrespect any of the Female Sex in all his life time;		
A412	he could not trust Fortune with that which he preferred above his life, which was his Reputation, by reason Fortune did not side with those that were honest and honourable, but renounced them; and since he could not be of both sides, he chose to be of that which was agreeable both to his Conscience, Nature and Education; for which choice Fortune did not onely declare her self his open Enemy,		
A413	Beautiful Truth, Great Fortune, and you the rest of my noble Friends; I am come a great and long journey in the behalf of my dear Friend the Duke of Newcastle; not to make more wounds, but, if it be possible, to heal those that are made already. Neither do I presume to be a Deity; but my onely request is, that you would be pleased to accept of my Offering, I being an humble and devout supplicant; and since no offering is more acceptable to the Gods, then the offering of Peace; in order to that, I desire to make an agreement between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle.		
A414	I came not here, said she, to hear Fortune flattered, but to hear the Cause decided between Fortune and the Duke; neither came I hither to speak Rhetorically and Eloquently, but to propound the case plainly and truly;		
A415	the Duke, whose Cause we argue, was and is my Foster-son; for I Honesty bred him from his Childhood, and made a perpetual friendship betwixt him and Gratitude, Charity and Generosity; and put him to School to Prudence, who taught him Wisdom, and informed him in the Rules of Temperance, Patience, Justice, and the like; then I put him into the University of Honour, where he learned all Honourable Qualities, Arts, and Sciences; afterward I sent him to travel through the World of Actions, and made Observation his Governor; and in those his travels, he contracted a friendship with Experience; all which, made him fit for Heavens Blessings, and Fortunes Favours:		
A416	the World is not so quiet as it was at first, I am much troubled at it; especially there are such continual Contentions and Divisions between the Worm- Bear- and Fly-men, the Ape-men, the Satyrs, the Spider-men, and all others of such sorts, that I fear they'l break out into an open Rebellion, and cause a great disorder; and the ruin of the Government		
A417	he could not trust Fortune with that which he preferred above his life, which was his Reputation, by reason Fortune did not side with those that were honest and honourable, but renounced them; and since he could not be of both sides, he chose to be of that which was agreeable both to his Conscience, Nature and Education;		
A418	the Duchess answered, That since she heard by her Imperial Majesty, how well and happily the World had been governed when she first came to be Empress thereof, she would advise her Majesty to introduce the same form of Government again, which had been before; that is, to have but one soveraign, one Religion, one Law, and one Language, so that all the World might be but as one united Family, without divisions; nay, like God, and his Blessed Saints and Angels: Otherwise, said she, it may in time prove as unhappy, nay, as miserable a World as that is from which I came, wherein are more soveraigns then Worlds, and more pretended Governours then Government, more Religions then Gods, and more Opinions in those Religions then Truths; more Laws then Rights, and more Bribes then Justices; more Policies then Necessities, and more Fears then Dangers; more Covetousness then Riches, more Ambitions then Merits, more Services then Rewards, more Languages then Wit, more Controversie then Knowledg, more Reports then noble Actions, and more Gifts by partiality, then according to Merit;		
A419	And since your Majesty complains much of the factions of the Bear- Fish- Fly- Ape- and Worm- men, the Satyrs, Spider-men, and the like, and of their perpetual disputes and quarrels, I would advise your Majesty to dissolve all their societies; for 'tis better to be without their intelligences, then to have an unquiet and disorderly Government. The truth is, said she, wheresoever Learning is, there is most commonly also Controversie and quarelling; for there be always some that will know more, and be wiser then others: some think their Arguments come nearer to Truth, and are more rational then others; some are so wedded to their own opinions, that they'l never yield to Reason; and others, though they find their Opinions not firmly grounded upon Reason, yet, for fear of receiving some disgrace by altering them, will nevertheless maintain them against all sense and reason, which must needs breed factions in their Schools, which at last break out into open Wars, and draw sometimes an utter ruin upon a State or Government.		
A420	the Duchess told them how some in her own World had been so ingenious, as to contrive Ships that could swim under Water, and asked, Whether they could do the like? The Giants answered, They had never heard of that Invention; nevertheless, they would try what might be done by Art, and spare no labour or industry to find it out.		
A421	Great, Heroick, and Famous Monarchs, I come hither to assist the King of Esfi against his Enemies, He being unjustly assaulted by many several Nations, which would fain take away His Hereditary Rights, and Prerogatives of the Narrow Seas; at which Unjustice, Heaven was much displeased, and for the Injuries He received from His Enemies, rewarded Him with an Absolute Power, so that now he is become the Head-Monarch of all this World; which Power, though you may envy, yet you can no wayes hinder Him; for all those that endeavour to resist His Power, shall onely get Loss for their Labour, and no Victory for their Profit. Wherefore my advice to you all is, To pay him Tribute justly and truly, that you may live Peaceably and Happily, and be rewarded with the Blessings of Heaven: which I wish you from my Soul.		
A422	the Emperor desir'd her advice how to set up a Theatre for Plays. The Duchess confessed her Ignorance in this Art, telling his Majesty that she knew nothing of erecting Theatres or Scenes, but what she had by an Immaterial Observation, when she was with the Empress's Soul in the chief City of E. Entring into one of their Theatres, whereof the Empress could give as much account to his Majesty, as her self. But both the Emperor and the Empress told the Duchess, That she could give directions how to make Plays. The Duchess answered, That she had as little skill to form a Play after the Mode, as she had to paint or make a Scene for shew. But you have made Plays, replied the Empress: Yes, answered the Duchess, I intended them for Plays; but the Wits of these present times condemned them as uncapable of being represented or acted, because they were not made up according to the Rules of Art; though I dare say, That the Descriptions are as good as any they have writ. The Emperor asked, Whether the Property of Plays were not to describe the several Humours, Actions and Fortunes of Mankind? 'Tis so, answered the Duchess. Why then, replied the Emperor, the natural Humours, Actions and Fortunes of Mankind, are not done by the Rules of Art: But, said the Duchess, it is the Art and Method of our Wits to despise all Descriptions of Wit, Humour, Actions and Fortunes that are without such Artificial Rules. The Emperor asked, Are those good Plays that are made so Methodically and Artificially? The Duchess answer'd, They were Good according to the Judgment of the Age, or Mode of the Nation, but not according to her Judgment: for truly, said she, in my Opinion, their Plays will prove a Nursery of whining Lovers, and not an Academy or School for Wise, Witty, Noble and well-behaved men. But I, replied the Emperor, desire such a Theatre as may make wise Men; and will have such Descriptions as are Natural, not Artificial. If your Majesty be of that Opinion, said the Duchess's Soul, then my Playes may be acted in your Blazing- World, when they cannot be acted in the Blinking-World of Wit; and the next time I come to visit your Majesty, I shall endeavour to order your Majesty's Theatre, to present such Playes as my Wit is capable to make. Then the Empress told the Duchess, That she loved a foolish Farse added to a wise Play. The Duchess answered, That no World in Nature had fitter Creatures for it than the Blazing-World: for, said she, the Lowse- men, the Bird-men, the Spider- and Fox-men, the Ape-men and Satyrs appear in a Farse extraordinary pleasant		
A423	One time the Duchess chanced to discourse with some of her acquaintance, of the Empress of the Blazing-World, who asked her what Pastimes and Recreations her Majesty did most delight in? The Duchess answered, That she spent most of her time in the study of Natural Causes and Effects, which was her chief delight and pastime; and that she loved to discourse sometimes with the most Learned persons of that World:		
A424	she loved to discourse sometimes with the most Learned persons of that World:		
A425	By this Poetical Description, you may perceive, that my ambition is not onely to be Empress, but Authoress of a whole World; and that the Worlds I have made, both the Blazing- and the other Philosophical World, mentioned in the first part of this Description, are framed and composed of the most pure, that is, the Rational parts of Matter, which are the parts of my Mind; which Creation was more easily and suddenly effected, than the Conquests of the two famous Monarchs of the World. Alexander and Cesar.		
A426	I have made my Blazing-World a Peaceable World,		
A427	But I esteeming Peace before Warr, Wit before Policy, Honesty before Beauty; instead of the figures of Alexander, Cesar, Hector, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses, Hellen, &c. chose rather the figure of Honest Margaret Newcastle, which now I would not change for all this Terrestrial World; and if any should like the World I have made, and be willing to be my Subjects, they may imagine themselves such, and they are such, I mean in their Minds, Fancies or Imaginations; but if they cannot endure to be Subjects, they may create Worlds of their own, and Govern themselves as they please. But yet let them have a care, not to prove unjust Usurpers, and to rob me of mine: for, concerning the Philosophical-world, I am Empress of it my self; and as for the Blazing-World, it having an Empress already, who rules it with great Wisdom and Conduct, which Empress is my dear Platonick Friend; I shall never prove so unjust, treacherous and unworthy to her, as to disturb her Government, much less to depose her from her Imperial Throne, for the sake of any other, but rather chuse to create another World for another Friend.		
A428	Heaven frowning at his Theft, raised such a Tempest,		
A429	they had an extraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers,		
A430	the Lady at first fancied her self in a very sad condition		
A431	she thought her self not onely safe, but very happy in their company		
A432	if they cannot endure to be Subjects, they may create Worlds of their own, and Govern themselves as they please		
A433	though they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile observations, and great practice; in so much that they could not onely tell the depth of the Sea in every place, but where there were shelves of Sand, Rocks, and other obstructions to be avoided by skilful and experienced Sea-men		
A434	they had an extraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers, and that was a certain Engin, which would draw in a great quantity of Air, and shoot forth Wind with a great force; this Engine in a calm, they placed behind their Ships, and in a storm, before; for it served against the raging waves, like Cannons against an hostile Army, or besieged Town		
A435	endeavoured to learn their language		
A436	Novelty discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in peace and tranquillity		
A437	The City it self was built of Gold; and their Architectures were noble, stately, and magnificent, not like our Modern, but like those in the Romans time; for, our Modern Buildings are like those Houses which Children use to make of Cards, one story above another, fitter for Birds, then Men;		
A438	No sooner was the Lady brought before the Emperor, but he conceived her to be some Goddess, and offered to worship her; which she refused, telling him, (for by that time she had pretty well learned their Language) that although she came out of another world, yet was she but a mortal		
A439	At which the Emperor rejoycing, made her his Wife, and gave her an absolute power to rule and govern all that World as she pleased		
A440	the Empress encouraged them in, especially those that had applied themselves to the study of several Arts and Sciences; for they were as ingenious and witty in the invention of profitable and useful Arts, as we are in our world, nay, more		
A441	Why they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last brake out into open Wars.		
A442	to avoid hereafter tedious disputes, and have the truth of the Phænomena's of Cœlestial Bodies more exactly known, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers, to observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which they did according to her Majesties Command		
A443	your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses		
A444	Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth		
A445	for, said they, we take more delight in Artificial delusions, then in Natural truths		
A446	The Empress at last consented to their request, but upon condition, that their disputes and quarrels should remain within their Schools, and cause no factions or disturbances in State, or Government		
A447	as Experience doth sufficiently witness		
A448	But since you have informed me, said she, of the various sorts and productions of Animal Creatures, I desire you to tell me what you have observed of their sensitive perceptions?		
A449	we shall hardly be able to give a satisfactory answer to it		
A450	After all this, the Empress desired the Worm men to give her a true Relation how frost was made upon the Earth?		
A451	they gave, according to their Observation, this following reason		
A452	This Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chymists, the Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a temperate degree of hea		
A453	This Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chymists, the Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a temperate degree of heat.		
A454	having taken much satisfaction in several of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and Observations		
A455	commanded them to give her an account of the several Transmutations which their Art was able to produce.		
A456	for both by my own Contemplation, and the Observations which I have made by my rational & sensitive perception upon Nature, and her works, I find, that Nature is but one Infinite Self-moving Body, which by the vertue of its self-motion, is divided into Infinite parts, which parts being restless, undergo perpetual changes and transmutations by their infinite compositions and divisions.		
A457	The Conferences of the Chymists being finished, the Empress made an Assembly of her Galenical Physicians, her Herbalists and Anatomists; and first she enquired of her Herbalists the particular effects of several Herbs and Drugs, and whence they proceeded?		
A458	for by dissecting some, we cannot prevent the production of others; so that our pains and labour will be to no purpose, unless to satisfie the vain curiosities of inquisitive men. The Empress replied, That such dissections would be very beneficial to Experimental Philosophers		
A459	such dissections would be very beneficial to Experimental Philosophers		
A460	hen we dissect dead Animals, said they, it is for no other end, but to observe what defects and distempers they had, that we may cure the like in living ones, so that all our care and industry concerns onely the preservation of Mank		
A461	as for Improbable Truth I know not what your meaning is; for Truth is more then Improbability: nay, there is so much difference between Truth and Improbability, that I cannot conceive it possible how they can be joined together		
A462	was troubled, that so wise and knowing a people should have no more knowledg of the Divine Truth		
A463	told them of the punishments for their sins, to wit, That after this life they should be tormented in an everlasting Fire		
A464	she preached Sermons of Comfort to those that repented of their sins, and were troubled at their own wickedness: Neither did the heat of the flame in the least hinder her		
A465	she desired to know		
A466	I pray inform me		
A467	the Empress desired to be informed		
A468	she desired to be informed		
A469	Let me now desire you to inform me		
A470	the Empress desired the Spirits to inform her		
A471	the Empress desired the Spirits to tell her		
A472	the Empress being very desirous to know		
A473	desired to know		
A474	desired to be further informed		
A475	to be better satisfied, desired the Worm-men to inform her		
A476	she desir'd to know		
A477	the Empress desired to know		
A478	the Empress asked them the reason

A480	Then she would fain know		
A481	It is the nature of Mankind to be inquisitive.		
A482	Natural desire of knowledg, answered the Spirits, is not blameable, so you do not go beyond what your Natural Reason can comprehend		
A483	she being desirous to know the Truth		
A484	Truth		
A485	Then, said she, I'le have the Soul of one of the most famous modern Writers, as either of Galileo, Gassendus, Des Cartes, Helmont, Hobbes, H. More, &c. The Spirits answered, That they were fine ingenious Writers, but yet so self-conceited, that they would scorn to be Scribes to a Woman.		
A486	the gift of Divine Knowledg		
A487	truly their meeting did produce such an intimate friendship between them, that they became Platonick Lovers, although they were both Femals		
A488	The Duchess answered Her Majesty, That it was true, that all or most of their Plays were taken out of old Stories; but yet they had new Actions, which being joined to old Stories, together with the addition of new Prologues, Scenes, Musick and Dancing, made new Plays.		
A489	But the Duke's Soul being wise, honest, witty, complaisant and noble, afforded such delight and pleasure to the Empress's Soul by his conversation, that these two souls became enamoured of each other		
A490	which the Duchess's soul perceiving, grew jealous at first, but then considering that no Adultery could be committed amongst Platonick Lovers, and that Platonism, was Divine, as being derived from Divine Plato, cast forth of her mind that Idea of Jealousie		
A491	They will never come to an agreement, unless there be a Judg or Umpire to decide the Case		
A492	A Judg, replied the Empress, is easie to be had; but to get an Impartial Judg, is a thing so difficult, that I doubt we shall hardly find one; for there is none to be had, neither in Nature, nor in Hell, but onely from Heaven;		
A493	Truth should hear, and decide the cause.		
A494	Honesty		
A495	preferred Honesty and Prudence before you		
A496	otherwise Prudence and Honesty will be the chief and onely Moral Deities of Mortals		
A497	Beautiful Truth,		
A498	no offering is more acceptable to the Gods, then the offering of Peace		
A499	Justice		
A500	the God of Justice opposed Fortune's Malice		
A501	In short, the true cause of Fortunes Malice to this Duke is, that he would never flatter her; for I Honesty, did command him not to do it, or else he would be forced to follow all her inconstant ways, and obey all her unjust commands, which would cause a great reproach to him:		
A502	to make a Peace		
A503	just and Impartial Judgment, she had alwayes a very great esteem		
A504	that is, to have but one soveraign, one Religion, one Law, and one Language, so that all the World might be but as one united Family, without divisions; nay, like God, and his Blessed Saints and Angels: Otherwise, said she, it may in time prove as unhappy, nay, as miserable a World as that is from which I came, wherein are more soveraigns then Worlds, and more pretended Governours then Government, more Religions then Gods, and more Opinions in those Religions then Truths		
A505	he truth is, said she, wheresoever Learning is, there is most commonly also Controversie and quarelling; for there be always some that will know more, and be wiser then others: some think their Arguments come nearer to Truth, and are more rational then others		
A506	who gave her Intelligence of all such things as she desired to know		
A507	I have chosen rather to quit my own Tranquility, Riches and Pleasure, than suffer you to be ruined and destroyed.		
A508	be rewarded with the Blessings of Heaven		
A509	you may live Peaceably and Happily		
A510	I love you so well, that I would make you as Great and Powerful a Monarchess, as I am of the Blazing-World. The Duchess's Soul humbly thank'd her Majesty, and told her, That she acknowledged and esteemed her Love beyond all things that are in Nature.		
A511	the joy which the Emperor had at her safe return; for he loved her beyond his Soul; and there was no love lost, for the Empress equal'd his Affection with no less love to him		
A512	and that by the hand of Justice, which was necessitated to punish their crime of stealing away a young and beauteous Lady.

A545	For it is the duty of an astronomer to compose the history of the celestial motions through careful and expert study.		
A546	Since he cannot in any way attain to the true causes, he will adopt whatever suppositions enable the motions to be computed correctly from the principles of geometry for the future as well as for the past.		
A547	The present author has performed both these duties excellently.		
A548	if they provide a calculus consistent with the observations, that alone is enough.		
A549	But neither of them will understand or state anything certain, unless it has been divinely revealed to him.		
A550	let us permit these new hypotheses also to become known, especially since they are admirable as well as simple and bring with them a huge treasure of very skillful observations.		
A551	I had learned that you had not merely mastered the discoveries of the ancient astronomers uncommonly well but had also formulated a new cosmology.		
A552	I can readily imagine, Holy Father, that as soon as some people hear that in this volume, which I have written about the revolutions of the spheres of the universe, I ascribe certain motions to the terrestrial globe, they will shout that I must be immediately repudiated together with this belief		
A553	For I am not so enamored of my own opinions that I disregard what others may think of them.		
A554	I am aware that a philosopher’s ideas are not subject to the judgement of ordinary persons, because it is his endeavor to seek the truth in all things, to the extent permitted to human reason by God.		
A555	I am aware that a philosopher’s ideas are not subject to the judgement of ordinary persons,		
A556	Yet I hold that completely erroneous views should be shunned.		
A557	Those who know that the consensus of many centuries has sanctioned the conception that the earth remains at rest in the middle of the heaven as its center would, I reflected, regard it as an insane pronouncement if I made the opposite assertion that the earth moves.		
A558	Therefore I debated with myself for a long time whether to publish the volume which I wrote to prove the earth’s motion or rather to follow the example of the Pythagoreans and certain others, who used to transmit philosophy’s secrets only to kinsmen and friends, not in writing but by word of mouth, as is shown by Lysis’ letter to Hipparchus. And they did so, it seems to me, not, as some suppose, because they were in some way jealous about their teachings, which would be spread around; on the contrary, they wanted the very beautiful thoughts attained by great men of deep devotion not to be ridiculed by those who are reluctant to exert themselves vigorously in any literary pursuit unless it is lucrative;		
A559	I had reason to fear on account of the novelty and unconventionality of my opinion		
A560	novelty and unconventionality of my opinion		
A561	Ile crazier my doctrine of the earth’s motion now appeared to most people, the argument ran, so much the more admiration and thanks would it gain after they saw the publication of my writings dispel the fog of absurdity by most luminous proofs.

A571	false,		
A572	how it occurred to me to venture to conceive any motion of the earth, against the traditional opinion of astronomers and almost against common sense.		
A573	I was impelled to consider a different system of deducing the motions of the universe’s spheres for no other reason than the realization that astronomers do not agree among themselves in their investigations of this subject. For, in the first place, they are so uncertain about the motion of the sun and moon that they cannot establish and observe a constant length even for the tropical year. Secondly, in determining the motions not only of these bodies but also of the other five planets, they do not use the same principles, assumptions, and explanations of the apparent revolutions and motions.		
A574	by this means they were unable to obtain any incontrovertible result in absolute agreement with the phenomena.		
A575	hose who devised the eccentrics seem thereby in large measure to have solved the problem of the apparent motions with appropriate calculations. But meanwhile they introduced a good many ideas which apparently contradict the first principles of uniform motion.		
A576	Nor could they elicit or deduce from the eccentrics the principal consideration, that is, the structure of the universe and the true symmetry of its parts.		
A577	For if the hypotheses assumed by them were not false, everything which follows from their hypotheses would be confirmed beyond any doubt.		
A578	against the traditional opinion of astronomers and almost against common sense.		
A579	understood with greater certainty		
A580	I undertook the task of rereading the works of all the philosophers which I could obtain to learn whether anyone had ever proposed other motions of the universe’s spheres than those expounded by the teachers of astronomy in the schools.		
A581	rereading the works of all the philosophers		
A582	the movements of the world machine, created for our sake by the best and most systematic Artisan of all, were not understood with greater certainty by the philosophers,		
A583	this confusion in the astronomical traditions		
A584	explanations		
A585	I knew that others before me had been granted the freedom to imagine any circles whatever for the purpose of explaining the heavenly phenomena.		
A586	I too would be readily permitted to ascertain whether explanations sounder than those of my predecessors could be found for the revolution of the celestial spheres on the assumption of some motion of the earth.		
A587	I too would be readily permitted to ascertain whether explanations sounder than those of my predecessors could be found

A591	examine and consider, not superficially but thoroughly, what I adduce in this volume in proof of these matters.		
A592	I do not run away from the judgement of anybody		
A593	you are considered the highest authority by virtue of the loftiness of your office and your love for all literature and astronomy too.		
A594	Hence by your prestige and judgement you can easily suppress calumnious attacks although, as the proverb has it, there is no remedy for a backbite.		
A595	by long and intense study I finally found that if the motions of the other planets are correlated with the orbiting of the earth, and are computed for the revolution of each planet, not only do their phenomena follow therefrom but also the order and size of all the planets and spheres, and heaven itself is so linked together that in no portion of it can anything be shifted without disrupting the remaining parts and the universe as a whole.		
A596	to what extent the motions and appearances of the other planets and spheres can be saved if they are correlated with the earth’s motions.		
A597	babblers who claim to be judges of astronomy although completely ignorant of the subject		
A598	badly distorting some passage of Scripture to their purpose,		
A599	will dare to find fault with my undertaking and censure it.		
A600	Perhaps there will be babblers who claim to be judges of astronomy although completely ignorant of the subject and, badly distorting some passage of Scripture to their purpose, will dare to find fault with my undertaking and censure it.		
A601	I disregard them even to the extent of despising their criticism as unfounded. For it is not unknown that Lactantius, otherwise an illustrious writer but hardly an astronomer, speaks quite childishly about the earth’s shape, when he mocks those who declared that the earth has the form of a globe.		
A602	Astronomy is written for astronomers.		
A603	To them my work too will seem, unless I am mistaken, to make some contribution also to the Church, at the head of which Your Holiness now stands. For not so long ago under Leo X the Lateran Council considered the problem of reforming the ecclesiastical calendar. The issue remained undecided then only because the lengths of the year and month and the motions of the sun and moon were regarded as not yet adequately measured. From that time on, at the suggestion of that most distinguished man, Paul, bishop of Fossombrone, who was then in charge of this matter, I have directed my attention to a more precise study of these topics.		
A604	the most beautiful objects, most deserving to be known.		
A605	phenomena in the sky,		
A606	appearance.		
A607	purity		
A608	free man,		
A609	vices		
A610	happiness		
A611	Among the many various literary and artistic pursuits which invigorate men’s minds, the strongest affection and utmost zeal should, I think, promote the studies concerned with the most beautiful objects, most deserving to be known.		
A612	What indeed is more beautiful than heaven, which of course contains all things of beauty? This is proclaimed by its very names (in Latin), caelum and mundus, the latter denoting purity and ornament, the former a carving.		
A613	Although all the good arts serve to draw man’s mind away from vices and lead it toward better things, this function can be more fully performed by this art, which also provides extraordinary intellectual pleasure. For when a man is occupied with things which he sees established in the finest order and directed by divine mana gement, will not the unremitting contemplation of them and a certain familiarity with them stimulate him to the best and to admiration for the Maker of everything, in whom are all happiness and every good?		
A614	The great benefit and adornment which this art confers on the commonwealth (not to mention the countless advantages to individuals) are most excellently observed by Plato. In the Laws, Book VII, he thinks that it should be cultivated chiefly because by dividing time into groups of days as months and years, it would keep the state alert and attentive to the festivals and sacrifices. Whoever denies its necessity for the teacher of any branch of higher learning is thinking foolishly, according to Plato. In his opinion it is highly unlikely that anyone lacking the requisite knowledge of the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies can become and be called godlike.		
A615	disagreement,		
A616	knowledge		
A617	observations		
A618	Nevertheless very many things, as we perceive, do not agree with the conclusions which ought to follow from his system,		
A619	"The main reason is that its principles and assumptions, called ""hypotheses"" by the Greeks, have been a source of disagreement, as we see, among most of those who undertook to deal with this subject, and so they did not rely on the same ideas."		
A620	An additional reason is that the motion of the planets and the revolution of the stars could not be measured with numerical precision and completely understood except with the passage of time and the aid of many earlier observations, through which this knowledge was transmitted to posterity from hand to hand, so to say.		
A621	To be sure, Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria, who far excels the rest by his wonderful skill and industry, brought this entire art almost to perfection with the help of observations extending over a period of more than four hundred years, so that there no longer seemed to be any gap which he had not closed. Nevertheless very many things, as we perceive, do not agree with the conclusions which ought to follow from his system, and besides certain other motions have been discovered which were not yet 2 known to him.		
A622	the motion of the heavenly bodies has eluded the skill of the astronomers.		
A623	There have already been widespread reports about the novel hypotheses of this work, which declares that the earth moves whereas the sun is at rest in the center of the universeHence certain scholars, I have no doubt, are deeply offended and believe that the liberal arts, which were established long ago on a sound basis, should not be thrown into confusion.		
A624	The philosopher will perhaps rather seek the semblance of the truth		
A625	But neither of them will understand or state anything certain, unless it has been divinely revealed to him		
A626	Therefore with the utmost earnestness I entreat you, most learned sir, unless I inconvenience you, to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars, and at the earliest possible moment to send me your writings on the sphere of the universe together with the tables and whatever else you have that is relevant to this subject.		
A627	I must be immediately repudiated together with this belief		
A628	For I am not so enamored of my own opinions that I disregard what others may think of them		
A629	Those who know that the consensus of many centuries has sanctioned the conception that the earth remains at rest in the middle of the heaven as its center would, I reflected, regard it as an insane pronouncement if I made the opposite assertion that the earth moves		
A630	Therefore I debated with myself for a long time whether to publish the volume which I wrote to prove the earth’s motion or rather to follow the example of the Pythagoreans and certain others, who used to transmit philosophy’s secrets only to kinsmen and friends, not in writing but by word of mouth, as is shown by Lysis’ letter to Hipparchus.		
A631	But while I hesitated for a long time and even resisted, my friends drew me back		
A632	hey exhorted me no longer to refuse, on account of the fear which I felt, to make my work available for the general use of students of astronomy.		
A633	not false		
A634	Even though what I am now saying may be obscure, it will nevertheless become clearer in the proper place.		
A635	For this reason I undertook the task of rereading the works of all the philosophers which I could obtain to learn whether anyone had ever proposed other motions of the universe’s spheres than those expounded by the teachers of astronomy in the schools		
A636	And even though the idea seemed absurd, nevertheless I knew that others before me had been granted the freedom to imagine any circles whatever for the purpose of explaining the heavenly phenomena. Hence I thought that I too would be readily permitted to ascertain whether explanations sounder than those of my predecessors could be found for the revolution of the celestial spheres on the assumption of some motion of the earth		
A637	I do not run away from the judgement of anybody at all,		
A638	I have no doubt that acute and learned astronomers will agree with me if, as this discipline especially requires, they are willing to examine and consider, not superficially but thoroughly, what I adduce in this volume in proof of these matters		
A639	To them my work too will seem, unless I am mistaken, to make some contribution also to the Church, at the head of which Your Holiness now stands.

From that time on, at the suggestion of that most distinguished man, Paul, bishop of Fossombrone, who was then in charge of this matter, I have directed my attention to a more precise study of these topics. But what I have accomplished in this regard, I leave to the judgement of Your Holiness in particular and of all other learned astronomers.

A643	I shall treat many topics differently from my predecessors, and yet I shall do so thanks to them, for it was they who first opened the road to the investigation of these very questions.		
A644	it is his endeavor to seek the truth in all things		
A645	to the extent permitted to human reason by God		
A646	je crois, sans m'amuser aux imaginations pointues dont vous chatouillez le Temps pour le faire marcher plus vite, que la Lune est un monde comme celui-ci; à qui le nôtre sert de Lune.		
A647	raisonnements		
A648	de sorte qu'à force d'appuyer cette croyance burlesque par des raisonnements presque sérieux, il s'en fallait peu que je n'y déférasse déjà, quand le miracle ou l'accident, la fortune, ou peut-être ce qu'on nommera vision, fiction, chimère ou folie, si on veut, me fournit l'occasion qui m'engagea à ce discours.		
A649	tantôt l'un le prenait pour une lucarne du Ciel; tantôt un autre assurait que c'était la platine où Diane dresse les rabats d'Apollon; un autre, que ce pouvait bien être le Soleil		
A650	Mais j'eus beau leur alléguer que _Pythagore_, _Epicure_, _Démocrite et de notre âge Copernic et Keppler_		
A651	Je demeurai si surpris, tant de voir un livre qui s'était apporté là tout seul, que du temps et de la feuille où il s'était rencontré ouvert, que je pris toute cette enchaînure d'incidents pour une inspiration de faire connaître aux hommes que la Lune est un monde.		
A652	raison		
A653	Mais, ajoutais-je, je ne saurais m'éclaircir de ce doute, si je ne monte jusque-là?		
A654	Prométhée fut bien autrefois au Ciel y dérober du feu. Suis-je moins hardi que lui? et ai-je lieu de n'en pas espérer un succès aussi favorable?		
A655	après avoir flatté mes rêveries de quelques moyens proportionnés à mon sujet, voici comment je montai au Ciel.		
A656	Mon bonheur fut grand de rencontrer un homme capable de hautes opinions, et qui ne s'étonna point, quand je lui dis qu'il fallait que la Terre eût tourné pendant mon élévation, puisque, ayant commencé de monter à deux lieues de Paris, j'étais tombé, par une ligne quasi-perpendiculaire, en Canada.		
A657	Ils veulent absolument que vous soyez magicien; et la plus grande grâce que vous puissiez obtenir d'eux est de ne passer que pour imposteur.		
A658	quelle grande vraisemblance avez-vous, pour vous figurer que le Soleil soit immobile, quand nous le voyons marcher? et quelle apparence que la Terre tourne avec tant de rapidité, quand nous la sentons ferme dessous nous?		
A659	nous le voyons marcher?		
A660	nous la sentons ferme dessous nous?		
A661	voici les raisons à peu près qui nous obligent à le préjuger.		
A662	il est du sens commun de croire que le Soleil a pris la place au centre de l'univers,		
A663	Mais pourquoi supposer le Ciel rond, puisque vous ne le sauriez savoir, et que, de toutes les figures, s'il n'a pas celle-ci, il est certain qu'il ne se peut mouvoir?		
A664	Parlons seulement des causes naturelles de ce mouvement.		
A665	Je ne vous reproche point vos excentèques, ni vos épicicles, lesquels vous ne sauriez expliquer que très confusément, et dont je sauve mon système.		
A666	je m'imagine que la Terre tourne, non point pour les raisons qu'allègue Copernic, mais parce que, le feu d'enfer _ainsi que vous apprend la Sainte-Ecriture_, étant enclos au centre de la terre, les damnés, qui veulent fuir l'ardeur de sa flamme, gravissent, pour s'en éloigner, contre la voûte, et font ainsi tourner la Terre, comme un chien fait tourner une roue, lorsqu'il court enfermé dedans.		
A667	il s'étonnait fort, vu que le système de Ptolémée était si peu probable, qu'il eût été si généralement reçu.		
A668	la plupart des hommes, qui ne jugent que par les sens, se sont laissé persuader à leurs yeux		
A669	Ajoutez à cela l'orgueil insupportable des humains,		
A670	je crois que les Planètes sont des mondes autour du Soleil, et que les étoiles fixes sont aussi des Soleils qui ont des Planètes autour d'eux, c'est-à-dire, des mondes que nous ne voyons pas d'ici à cause de leur petitesse, et parce que leur lumière empruntée ne saurait venir jusqu'à nous.		
A671	des mondes que nous ne voyons pas d'ici		
A672	vu que la Sainte-Ecriture parle seulement d'un que Dieu créa		
A673	la Sainte-Ecriture parle seulement d'un que Dieu créa		
A674	la Nouvelle-France, où nous sommes, en produit un exemple bien convaincant		
A675	je vous ferai observer, par le moyen d'une lunette excellente, que certaines obscurités, qui d'ici paraissent des taches, sont des mondes qui se construisent.		
A676	mon raisonnement le   cédera toujours en ces sortes de choses à la Foi.		
A677	si vous voulez m'obliger à   vous rendre raison de ce que me fournit mon imagination, c'est m'ôter   la parole, et m'obliger de vous confesser que mon raisonnement le   cédera toujours en ces sortes de choses à la Foi.		
A678	Nous eûmes, le lendemain et les jours suivants, des entretiens de pareille nature.		
A679	Je m'en allais, dès qu'elle était levée, rêvant, parmi les bois, à la conduite et à la réussite de mon entreprise;		
A680	J'avais fait une machine que je m'imaginais capable de m'élever autant que je voudrais, en sorte que, rien de tout ce que j'y croyais nécessaire n'y manquant, je m'assis dedans, et me précipitai en l'air, du haut d'une roche.		
A681	je retombai de plus belle au dessein de monter à la Lune.		
A682	il n'y aurait personne qui ne prît cette machine pour un dragon de feu.		
A683	quand on eut découvert l'invention du ressort, quelques-uns dirent qu'il y fallait attacher quantité de fusées volantes, parce que, leur rapidité les ayant enlevées bien haut, et le ressort agitant ses grandes ailes, il n'y aurait personne qui ne prît cette machine pour un dragon de feu.		
A684	selon le calcul que j'ai fait depuis		
A685	Cette aventure extraordinaire me gonfla le cœur d'une joie si peu commune que, ravi de me voir délivré d'un danger assuré, j'eus l'impudence de philosopher là-dessus.		
A686	je me vis tout d'un coup choir les pieds en haut, sans avoir culbuté en aucune façon; encore, ne m'en fussé-je pas aperçu, si je n'eusse senti ma tête chargée du poids de mon corps.		
A687	les réfractions éloignées du Soleil venant à confondre la diversité des corps et des climats, il ne m'avait plus paru que comme une grande plaque d'or		
A688	J'ai souvent fait depuis réflexion sur ce que le vulgaire assure qu'en se précipitant d'un lieu fort haut, on est étouffé avant de toucher la terre; et j'ai conclu, de mon aventure, qu'il en avait menti,		
A689	et j'ai conclu, de mon aventure, qu'il en avait menti,		
A690	je résolus de marcher jusqu'à ce que la Fortune me fît rencontrer la compagnie, de quelques bêtes, ou de la mort.		
A691	ils tenaient que, la Nature ayant donné aux hommes, comme aux bêtes, deux jambes et deux bras, ils s'en devaient servir comme eux.		
A692	le Ciel, fléchi de mes douleurs et fâché de voir profaner le Temple de son maître		
A693	Mais le Ciel, fléchi de mes douleurs et fâché de voir profaner le Temple de son maître, voulut qu'un jour, comme j'étais attaché au bout d'une corde, avec laquelle le charlatan me faisait sauter pour divertir le monde, j'entendis la voix d'un homme qui me demanda en grec qui j'étais.		
A694	Il y a du vulgaire, ici comme là, qui ne peut souffrir la pensée des choses où il n'est point accoutumé.		
A695	si quelqu'un de cette terre avait monté dans la vôtre, avec la hardiesse de se dire homme, vos savants le feraient étouffer comme un monstre.		
A696	m'avait reconnu pour un homme du monde dont je me disais		
A697	tous ces grands personnages n'ayant laissé en ce monde à leurs places que le fantôme de leurs vertus,		
A698	le peuple de votre Terre devint si stupide et si grossier que mes compagnons et moi perdîmes tout le plaisir que nous avions autrefois pris à l'instruire.		
A699	j'ai rôdé beaucoup en Europe et conversé avec des personnes que possible vous aurez connues.		
A700	j'ai enseigné quantité de souplesses et de secrets naturels, qui sans doute les auront fait passer pour de Grands Magiciens.		
A701	ce fut moi qui lui conseillai, pendant qu'il était à l'Inquisition dans Rome, de styler son visage et son corps aux postures ordinaires de ceux dont il avait besoin de connaître l'intérieur, afin d'exciter chez soi par une même assiette les pensées que cette même situation avait appelées dans ses adversaires, parce qu'ainsi il ménagerait mieux leur arme, quand il la connaîtrait,		
A702	le seul homme libre que vous ayez.		
A703	pourquoi je tâchai de lui faire accepter trois fioles: la première était pleine d'huile de talk, l'autre, de poudre de projection, et la dernière, d'or potable; mais il les refusa avec un dédain plus généreux que Diogène ne reçut les compliments d'Alexandre.		
A704	il est presque exempt de guerres		
A705	les hommes y sont amateurs de la vérité		
A706	qu'on n'y voit point de Pédants		
A707	que les Philosophes ne se laissent persuader qu'à la raison et que l'autorité d'un savant, ni le plus grand nombre, ne l'emportent point sur l'opinion d'un batteur en grange, quand il raisonne aussi fortement.		
A708	Bref, en ce pays, on ne compte pour insensés que les Sophistes et les Orateurs.		
A709	Vous vous imaginez, vous autres, que ce que vous ne sauriez comprendre est spirituel ou qu'il n'est point; mais cette conséquence est très fausse, et c'est un témoignage qu'il y a dans l'univers un million peut-être de choses, qui, pour être connues, demanderaient en vous un million d'organes tous différents.		
A710	vous autres ne sauriez donner jusqu'à ces hautes conceptions que par la foi, à cause que les proportions à ces miracles vous manquent,		
A711	J'adoucissais ainsi la dureté des mauvais traitements de mon maître par les visites que me rendait cet officieux Démon		
A712	ils me prenaient pour un animal des mieux enracinés dans la catégorie des Brutes,		
A713	c'est une invention tout ensemble et bien utile et bien agréable;		
A714	ses merveilleux entretiens me faisaient passer sans ennui les violences de ma captivité.		
A715	les violences de ma captivité.		
A716	Presque tous les jours le Démon me venait visiter, et ses merveilleux entretiens me faisaient passer sans ennui les violences de ma captivité.		
A717	avec l'affliction que me faisait sentir un traitement de bête,		
A718	Vous m'aviez promis que les bons offices que je vous rendrais ne vous sortiraient jamais de la mémoire, et cependant il semble que vous ne m'ayez jamais vu!		
A719	l y a très grande apparence à ce que vous dites, et je viens moi-même d'en expérimenter quelque chose;		
A720	ils ont l'industrie de mêler parmi leur poudre et leur plomb une certaine composition qui tue, plume, rôtit et assaisonne le gibier.		
A721	Après ce déjeuner, nous nous mîmes en état de partir, et avec mille grimaces dont ils se servent, quand ils veulent témoigner de l'affection, l'hôte reçut un papier de mon Démon. Je lui demandai si c'était une obligation pour la valeur de l'écot. Il me repartit que non; qu'il ne lui devait rien et que c'étaient des Vers.  --Comment, des vers? lui répliquai-je. Les taverniers sont donc ici curieux de rimes?  --C'est, me dit-il, la monnaie du pays, et la dépense que nous venons de faire céans s'est trouvée monter à un sixain que je lui viens de donner. Je ne craignais pas de demeurer court; car, quand nous ferions ici ripaille pendant huit jours, nous ne saurions dépenser un Sonnet, et j'en ai quatre sur moi, avec deux Epigrammes, deux Odes et une Eglogue.  --Et plût à Dieu, lui dis-je, que cela fût de même en notre monde! J'y connais beaucoup d'honnêtes Poètes qui meurent de faim, et qui feraient bonne chère, si on payait les Traiteurs en cette monnaie.		
A722	quand quelqu'un meurt de faim, ce n'est jamais qu'un buffle, et les personnes d'esprit font toujours grande chère.		
A723	J'admirais, tout extasié, la police judicieuse de ce pays-là,		
A724	la conclusion que j'étais sans doute la femelle du petit animal de la Reine fut celle des grands comme celle du peuple.		
A725	qui opinait pour nous avec plus de ferveur protestait que notre entretien était un grognement que la joie d'être rejoints, par un instinct naturel, nous faisait bourdonner.		
A726	la dignité de notre nation, en faveur de qui l'univers ne produit des hommes que pour nous donner des esclaves, et pour qui la Nature ne saurait engendrer que des matières de rire.		
A727	Un jour, mon mâle (car on me prenait pour la femelle) me conta que ce qui l'avait véritablement obligé de courir toute la terre, et enfin de l'abandonner pour la Lune, était qu'il n'avait pu trouver un seul pays où l'imagination même fût en liberté.		
A728	'il n'avait pu trouver un seul pays où l'imagination même fût en liberté.		
A729	où l'imagination même fût en liberté.		
A730	quoi que vous puissiez dire de beau, s'il est contre les principes des Docteurs de drap, vous êtes un idiot, un fou, et quelque chose de pis.		
A731	On m'a voulu mettre, en mon pays, à l'Inquisition, parce qu'à la barbe des pédants j'avais soutenu qu'il y avait du vide, et que je ne connaissais point de matière au monde plus pesante l'une que l'autre.		
A732	à la barbe des pédants j'avais soutenu qu'il y avait du vide, et que je ne connaissais point de matière au monde plus pesante l'une que l'autre.		
A733	j'avais soutenu qu'il y avait du vide, et que je ne connaissais point de matière au monde plus pesante l'une que l'autre.		
A734	de quelles probabilités il appuyait une opinion si peu reçue.		
A735	«Mais vous me demanderez pourquoi donc le fer, les métaux, la terre, le bois descendent plus vite à ce centre qu'une éponge, si ce n'est à cause qu'elle est pleine d'air, qui tend naturellement en haut? Ce n'en est point du tout la raison, et voici comment je vous réponds:		
A736	Mais, m'objecterez-vous, vous supposez du vide comme si vous l'aviez prouvé, et c'est cela dont nous sommes en dispute!		
A737	nous philosophions, car nous n'aimions guère ni l'un ni l'autre à nous entretenir des choses basses:		
A738	nous philosophions,		
A739	Je suis bien fâché, dit-il, de voir un esprit de la trempe du vôtre infecté des erreurs du vulgaire.		
A740	Il faut donc que vous sachiez, malgré le pédantisme d'Aristote, dont retentissent aujourd'hui toutes les classes de votre France, que tout est en tout,		
A741	cette opinion fasse aux scolares les yeux grands comme des salières		
A742	elle est plus aisée à prouver qu'à persuader.		
A743	car ce petit Espagnol avait l'esprit joli.		
A744	quelques-uns nous jetaient des pierres; d'autres, des noix; d'autres, de l'herbe. Il n'était bruit que des bêtes du Roi.		
A745	j'appris plus tôt que lui à entendre leur langue et à l'écorcher un peu: ce qui fit qu'on nous considéra d'une autre façon qu'on n'avait fait, et les nouvelles coururent aussitôt par tout le Royaume qu'on avait trouvé deux hommes sauvages, plus petits que les autres,		
A746	Cette créance allait prendre racine à force d'être confirmée, sans les Docteurs du pays, qui s'y opposèrent, disant que c'était une impiété épouvantable de croire que non seulement des bêtes, mais des monstres, fussent de leur espèce.		
A747	--Il y aurait bien plus d'apparence, ajoutaient les moins passionnés, que nos animaux domestiques participassent au privilège de l'humanité, et de l'immortalité, par conséquent, à cause qu'ils sont nés dans notre pays, qu'une bête monstrueuse qui se dit née je ne sais où dans la Lune et puis, considérez la différence qui se remarque entre nous et eux.		
A748	notre Justice.		
A749	en ôtant les deux pieds à ces monstres, les a mis en état de ne pouvoir échapper à notre Justice.		
A750	J'entendais tous les jours, à ma loge, faire ces contes, ou d'autres semblables; et ils en bridèrent si bien l'esprit des peuples sur cet article, qu'il fut arrêté que je ne passerais tout au plus que pour un perroquet sans plumes; car ils confirmaient les persuadés, sur ce que, non plus qu'un oiseau, je n'avais que deux pieds. Cela fit qu'on me mit en cage par ordre exprès du Conseil d'en haut.		
A751	j'en contai des plus belles.		
A752	On vint jusque-là, que le Conseil fut contraint de faire publier un Arrêt, par lequel on défendait de croire que j'eusse de la raison,		
A753	Cependant la définition de ce que j'étais partagea la ville en deux factions.		
A754	Le parti qui soutenait en ma faveur		
A755	demandèrent une assemblée des Etats, pour résoudre cette controverse.		
A756	assemblée des Etats, pour résoudre cette controverse.		
A757	les arbitres pacifièrent l'animosité par le nombre des intéressés qu'ils égalèrent,		
A758	Les Examinateurs m'interrogèrent, entre autres choses, de Philosophie: je leur exposai, tout à la bonne foi, ce que jadis mon Régent m'en avait appris, mais ils ne mirent guère à me le réfuter par beaucoup de raisons convaincantes; de sorte que, n'y pouvant répondre, j'alléguai pour dernier refuge les principes d'Aristote, qui ne me servirent pas davantage que les sophismes; car, en deux mots, ils m'en découvrirent la fausseté.		
A759	Cet Aristote, me dirent-ils, dont vous vantez si fort la science, accommodait sans doute les principes à sa Philosophie, au lieu d'accommoder sa Philosophie aux principes		
A760	et encore devait-il les prouver au moins plus raisonnables que ceux des autres Sectes dont vous nous avez parlé.		
A761	C'est pourquoi le bon seigneur ne trouvera pas mauvais si nous lui baisons les mains.		
A762	comme ils virent que je ne clabaudais autre chose, sinon qu'ils n'étaient pas plus savants qu'Aristote, et qu'on m'avait défendu de discuter contre ceux qui niaient les principes, ils conclurent tous d'une commune voix que je n'étais pas un homme, mais possible quelque espèce d'autruche,		
A763	qu'on m'avait défendu de discuter contre ceux qui niaient les principes,		
A764	raison,		
A765	toute la Cour se divertissait à me faire jaser.		
A766	la plus gentille de toutes ayant conçu quelque amitié pour moi,		
A767	-Réjouissez-vous, me dit-elle, hier dans le Conseil on conclut la guerre contre le Roi [notes de musique]. J'espère, parmi l'embarras des préparatifs, pendant que notre Monarque et ses sujets seront éloignés, faire naître l'occasion de vous sauver.		
A768	tout cela avec tant d'égalité qu'il n'y a pas dans une armée un seul homme plus que dans l'autre,		
A769	de l'autre côté, les géants ont en tête les colosses; les escrimeurs, les adroits; les vaillants, les courageux; les débiles, les faibles; les indisposés, les malades; les robustes, les forts; et, si quelqu'un entreprenait de frapper un autre que son ennemi désigné, à moins qu'il ne pût justifier que c'était par méprise, il est condamné comme couard. Après la bataille donnée, on compte les blessés, les morts, les prisonniers; car, pour les fuyards, il ne s'en trouve point; si les pertes se trouvent égales de part et d'autre, ils tirent à la courte paille à qui se proclamera victorieux.		
A770	il y a d'autres armées, plus nombreuses, de savants et d'hommes d'esprit, des disputes desquelles dépend entièrement le triomphe ou la servitude des Etats.  «Un savant est opposé à un autre savant, un spirituel à un autre spirituel, et un judicieux à un autre judicieux. Au reste, le triomphe que remporte un Etat en cette façon est compté pour trois victoires à force ouverte.		
A771	on rompt l'assemblée, et le peuple vainqueur choisit pour être son Roi, ou celui des ennemis ou le sien.»		
A772	le peuple vainqueur choisit pour être son Roi,		
A773	j'alléguais, pour exemple d'une bien plus forte politique, les coutumes de notre Europe, où le Monarque n'avait garde d'omettre aucun de ses avantages pour vaincre;		
A774	vos Princes ne prétextent pas leurs armements, du droit?		
A775	Si fait, lui répliquai-je, et de la justice de leur cause.		
A776	Pourquoi donc, continua-t-elle, ne choisissent-ils des arbitres non suspects, pour être accordés? Et, s'il se trouve qu'ils aient autant de droit l'un que l'autre, qu'ils demeurent comme ils étaient, ou qu'ils jouent en un coup de piquet la Ville ou la Province dont ils sont en dispute?		
A777	Après la proclamation de la victoire,		
A778	Croiriez-vous, par votre foi, ayant vaincu sur le pré votre ennemi seul à seul, l'avoir vaincu de bonne guerre, si vous étiez maillé, et lui, non; s'il n'avait qu'un poignard, et vous une estocade; enfin s'il était manchot, et que vous eussiez deux bras? Cependant, avec toute l'égalité que vous recommandez, tant à vos gladiateurs, ils ne se battent jamais pareils; car l'un sera de grande, l'autre, de petite taille; l'un sera adroit, l'autre n'aura jamais manié d'épée; l'un sera robuste, l'autre faible; et, quand même ces disproportions seraient égales, qu'ils seraient aussi adroits et aussi forts l'un que l'autre, encore ne seraient-ils pas pareils, car l'un des deux aura peut-être plus de courage que l'autre; et, sous l'ombre que cet emporté ne considérera pas le péril, qu'il sera bilieux, qu'il aura plus de sang, qu'il avait le cœur plus serré, avec toutes ces qualités qui font le courage, comme si ce n'était pas, aussi bien qu'une épée, une arme que son ennemi n'a point, il s'ingère de se ruer éperdument sur lui, de l'effrayer, et d'ôter la vie à ce pauvre homme, qui prévoit le danger, dont la chaleur est étouffée dans la pituite, et duquel le cœur est trop vaste pour unir les esprits nécessaires à dissiper cette glace qu'on appelle _poltronnerie_. Ainsi vous louez cet homme d'avoir tué son ennemi avec avantage, et, le louant de hardiesse, vous le louez d'un péché contre nature, puisque sa hardiesse tend à la destruction.		
A779	avoir bien égalé les avantages de deux ennemis, quand vous les avez choisis tous deux grands, tous deux adroits, tous deux pleins de courage; mais ce n'est pas encore assez, puisqu'il faut qu'enfin le vainqueur surmonte par adresse, par force, et par fortune.		
A780	c'est tromper, c'est trahir, et la tromperie et la trahison ne doivent pas faire l'estime d'un véritable généreux.		
A781	Tout de même, celui-là n'a point été surmonté, à cause qu'il ne s'est point trouvé, dans ce moment, disposé à pouvoir résister aux violences de son adversaire.		
A782	c'est la Fortune qu'on doit couronner: il n'y a rien contribué; et enfin le vaincu n'est non plus blâmable que le joueur de dés, qui sur dix-sept points en voit faire dix-huit.»		
A783	On lui confessa qu'il avait raison; mais qu'il était impossible, selon les apparences humaines, d'y mettre ordre, et qu'il valait mieux subir un petit inconvénient, que de s'abandonner à cent autres de plus grande importance.		
A784	hors les coupables convaincus, tout homme a pouvoir sur toute femme, et une femme tout de même pourrait appeler un homme en Justice, qui l'aurait refusée.		
A785	les gens du Conseil avaient dit, dans la dernière assemblée, que c'étaient les femmes principalement qui publiaient que j'étais homme, afin de couvrir sous ce prétexte le désir qui les brûlait de se mêler aux bêtes, et de commettre avec moi sans vergogne des péchés contre nature.		
A786	Ce n'est pas qu'en ce Pays l'impudicité soit un crime; au contraire, hors les coupables convaincus, tout homme a pouvoir sur toute femme, et une femme tout de même pourrait appeler un homme en Justice, qui l'aurait refusée.		
A787	la définition de mon être		
A788	ses opinions sur la structure du Monde: elles me semblèrent ingénieuses; et, sans qu'il passa jusqu'à son origine, qu'il soutenait éternelle, j'eusse trouvé sa Philosophie beaucoup plus raisonnable que la nôtre.		
A789	Mais, sitôt que je l'entendis soutenir une rêverie si contraire à ce que la Foi nous apprend, je brisai avec lui, dont il ne fit que rire; ce qui m'obligea de lui dire que, puisqu'ils en venaient là, je recommençais à croire que leur Monde n'était qu'une Lune.		
A790	Aristote assure que ce n'est que la Lune; et, si vous aviez dit le contraire dans les Classes où j'ai fait mes études, on vous aurait sifflés.		
A791	Mais d'autres savants, plus emportés que les premiers, avertis que j'avais osé dire que la Lune d'où je venais était un Monde, et que leur Monde n'était qu'une Lune, crurent que cela leur fournissait un prétexte assez juste pour me faire condamner à l'eau: c'est la façon d'exterminer les impies.		
A792	Pour cet effet, ils furent en corps faire leur plainte au Roi, qui leur promit justice, et ordonna que je serais remis sur la sellette.		
A793	qui leur promit justice, et ordonna que je serais remis sur la sellette.		
A794	c'était une trompette qu'il avait tout exprès choisie, afin que la violence de ce son martial échauffât leurs esprits à ma mort,		
A795	afin d'empêcher par cette émotion que le raisonnement ne pût faire son office,		
A796	Justes, écoutez-moi! vous ne sauriez condamner cet Homme, ce Singe ou ce Perroquet,		
A797	Justes, écoutez-moi! vous ne sauriez condamner cet Homme, ce Singe ou ce Perroquet, pour avoir dit que la Lune est un Monde d'où il venait;		
A798	s'il est homme, quand même il ne serait pas venu de la Lune, puisque tout homme est libre, ne lui est-il pas libre aussi de s'imaginer ce qu'il voudra?		
A799	s'il est homme, quand même il ne serait pas venu de la Lune, puisque tout homme est libre,		
A800	ne lui est-il pas libre aussi de s'imaginer ce qu'il voudra?		
A801	Vous le forcerez bien à dire que la Lune n'est pas un Monde,		
A802	mais il ne le croira pas pourtant;		
A803	car, pour croire quelque chose, il faut qu'il se présente à son imagination certaines possibilités plus grandes au _oui_ qu'au _non_; à moins que vous ne lui fournissiez ce vraisemblable, ou qu'il ne vienne de soi-même s'offrir à son esprit, il vous dira bien qu'il croit, mais il ne le croira pas pour cela.		
A804	supposé qu'il soit animal sans raison, en auriez-vous vous-mêmes de l'accuser d'avoir péché contre elle?		
A805	De croire que cette savante Nature qui a fait le Monde et la Lune ne sache ce que c'est elle-même, et que vous autres, qui n'avez de connaissance que ce que vous en tenez d'elle, le sachiez plus certainement, cela serait bien ridicule.		
A806	qui n'avez de connaissance que ce que vous en tenez d'elle,		
A807	il faut qu'il se présente à son imagination certaines possibilités plus grandes au _oui_ qu'au _non_;		
A808	Mais, quand même la passion vous ferait renoncer à vos principes, et que vous supposeriez que la Nature ne guidât pas les bêtes, rougissez à tout le moins des inquiétudes que vous causent les caprices d'une bête.		
A809	En vérité, Messieurs, si vous rencontriez un homme d'âge mûr, qui veillât à la police d'une fourmilière, pour tantôt donner un soufflet à la fourmi qui aurait fait choir sa compagne, tantôt en emprisonner une qui aurait dérobé à sa voisine un grain de blé, tantôt mettre en justice une autre qui aurait abandonné ses œufs, ne l'estimeriez-vous pas insensé de vaquer à des choses trop au-dessous de lui, et de prétendre assujettir à la raison des animaux qui n'en ont pas l'usage? Comment donc, vénérable assemblée, défendrez-vous l'intérêt que vous prenez aux caprices de ce petit animal? Justes, j'ai dit.»		
A810	le Roi prononça:  «Que dorénavant je serais censé homme, comme tel mis en liberté,		
A811	«Que dorénavant je serais censé homme, comme tel mis en liberté,		
A812	je me dédirais publiquement d'avoir soutenu que la Lune était un Monde, à cause du scandale que la nouveauté de cette opinion aurait pu apporter dans l'âme des faibles.»		
A813	Tel est ce que le Conseil trouve bon que vous croyiez.»		
A814	je n'eusse publié dans les compagnies la vigueur et la force de votre esprit,		
A815	La fin de mes remerciements nous vit entrer chez lui;		
A816	il m'entretint, jusqu'au repas, des ressorts qu'il avait fait jouer pour obliger mes ennemis, malgré tous les plus spécieux scrupules dont ils avaient embabouiné le Peuple, à se déporter d'une poursuite si injuste.		
A817	il m'entretint, jusqu'au repas, des ressorts qu'il avait fait jouer		
A818	ce serait un second Socrate, s'il pouvait régler ses lumières, et ne point étouffer dans le vice les grâces dont Dieu continuellement le visite, et ne plus affecter le libertinage, comme il fait, par une chimérique ostentation et une affectation de s'acquérir la réputation d'homme d'esprit.		
A819	me répondit que c'était à cause de son âge, parce qu'en ce Monde-là les vieux rendaient toute sorte de respect et de déférence aux jeunes; bien plus, que les pères obéissent à leurs enfants, aussitôt que, par l'avis du Sénat des Philosophes, ils avaient atteint l'âge de raison.		
A820	elle ne répugne point à la droite raison;		
A821	droite raison		
A822	n'est-il pas plus capable de gouverner une famille, qu'un infirme sexagénaire, pauvre hébété, dont la neige de soixante hivers a glacé l'imagination,		
A823	Lorsque vous déférez au plus fort, n'est-ce pas afin qu'il vous soit obligé d'une victoire que vous ne lui sauriez disputer?		
A824	Mais, direz-vous, toutes les lois de notre Monde font retentir avec soin ce respect qu'on doit aux vieillards?		
A825	ont fait comme les législateurs aux fausses religions, un mystère de ce qu'ils n'ont pu trouver_.		
A826	mais ce sont des inventions trop ridicules par votre foi. Y a-t-il quelque place sur votre corps plus sacrée ou plus maudite l'une que l'autre; pourquoi commette-je un péché quand je me touche par la pièce du milieu et non pas quand je touche mon oreille ou mon talon, est-ce à cause qu'il y a du chatouillement?		
A827	Je ne suis pas si surpris, répliquai-je, qu'il s'abstienne de la chair, et de toutes choses qui ont eu vie sensitive; car, en notre Monde, les Pythagoriciens, et même quelques saints anachorètes, ont usé de ce régime; mais de n'oser, par exemple, couper un chou, de peur de le blesser, cela me semble tout à fait ridicule.  --Et moi, répondit mon Démon, je trouve beaucoup d'apparence en son opinion. Car, dites-moi, ce chou dont vous parlez n'est-il pas comme vous un être existant de la Nature?		
A828	Si on dit que nous sommes faits à l'image du premier Etre, et non pas le chou? Quand il serait vrai, nous avons, en souillant notre âme, par où nous lui ressemblons, effacé cette ressemblance, puisqu'il n'y a rien de plus contraire à Dieu que le péché.		
A829	Le péché de massacrer un homme n'est pas si grand, parce qu'un jour il revivra, que de couper un chou et lui ôter la vie, à lui qui n'en a point d'autre à espérer.		
A830	Il est vrai que nous naquîmes les premiers; mais, dans la famille de Dieu, il n'y a point de droit d'aînesse:		
A831	si donc les choux n'eurent point de part avec nous du fief de l'immortalité, ils furent sans doute avantagés de quelque autre qui, par sa grandeur, récompensât sa brièveté; c'est peut-être un intellect universel, une connaissance parfaite de toutes les choses dans leurs causes;		
A832	Souvenez-vous donc, ô de tous les animaux le plus superbe! qu'encore qu'un chou que vous coupez ne dise mot, il n'en pense pas moins.		
A833	le pauvre végétant n'a pas des organes propres à hurler comme vous; il n'en a pas pour frétiller ni pour pleurer; il en a toutefois, par lesquels il se plaint du tort que vous lui faites, et par lesquels il attire sur vous la vengeance du Ciel.		
A834	il en a toutefois, par lesquels il se plaint du tort que vous lui faites, et par lesquels il attire sur vous la vengeance du Ciel.		
A835	Dans toutes les maisons, il y a un Physionome, entretenu du public, qui est à peu près ce qu'on appellerait chez vous un médecin, hormis qu'il n'y gouverne que les sains et qu'il ne juge des diverses façons dont il nous fait traiter, que par la proportion, figure et symétrie de nos membres, par les linéaments du visage, le coloris de la chair, la délicatesse du cuir, l'agilité de la masse, le son de la voix, la teinture, la force et la dureté du poil.		
A836	Il me reste à prouver qu'il y a des Mondes infinis dans un Monde infini. Représentez-vous donc l'univers comme un animal; que les étoiles, qui sont des Mondes, sont dans ce grand animal, comme d'autres grands animaux, qui servent réciproquement de mondes à d'autres peuples, tels que nous, nos chevaux, etc., et que nous, à notre tour, sommes aussi des Mondes à l'égard de certains animaux encore plus petits sans comparaison que nous, comme sont certains vers, des poux, des cirons;		
A837	N'importe, repartit le jeune homme; vous devez obéir aveuglément, ne point pénétrer dans mes ordres, et vous souvenir seulement de ce que je vous ai commandé.		
A838	Lorsqu'elle fut apportée, il la saisit par le bras, et la fouetta un gros quart d'heure.  --Or sus! vaurien, continua-t-il, en punition de votre désobéissance, je veux que vous serviez aujourd'hui de risée à tout le monde, et, pour cet effet, je vous commande de ne marcher que sur deux pieds le reste de la journée.		
A839	les mobiles, comme par exemple celle où nous sommes maintenant, sont faites comme je vais vous dire. L'architecte construit chaque Palais, ainsi que vous voyez, d'un bois fort léger; il pratique dessous quatre roues; dans l'épaisseur de l'un des murs, il place dix gros soufflets, dont les tuyaux passent, d'une ligne horizontale, à travers le dernier étage, de l'un à l'autre pignon, en sorte que, quand on veut traîner les Villes autre part (car on les change d'air à toutes les saisons), chacun déplie sur l'un des côtés de son logis quantité de larges voiles au-devant des soufflets; puis, ayant bandé un ressort pour les faire jouer, leurs maisons, en moins de huit jours, avec les bouffées continuelles que vomissent ces monstres à vent, sont emportées, si on veut, à plus de cent lieues.		
A840	Ce qui m'a fort édifié, continua-t-il, c'est quand j'ai reconnu que le motif principal de son voyage était de se faire Chrétienne.		
A841	Ainsi, je lui ai promis d'aider son dessein de toutes mes forces, et d'inventer, pour cet effet, une machine capable de tenir trois ou quatre personnes, dans laquelle vous pourrez monter ensemble dès aujourd'hui		
A842	Je vais m'appliquer sérieusement à l'exécution de cette entreprise:		
A843	Il prouve là-dedans que toutes les choses sont vraies et déclare la façon d'unir physiquement les vérités de chaque contradictoire, comme, par exemple, que le blanc est noir et que le noir est blanc; qu'on peut être et n'être pas, en même temps; qu'il peut y avoir une montagne sans vallée; que le néant est quelque chose, et que toutes les choses qui sont ne sont point. Mais remarquez qu'il prouve tous ces inouïs paradoxes, sans aucune raison captieuse ou sophistique.		
A844	S'il lui arrive de vous scandaliser, ou de faire par quelque raisonnement chanceler votre foi, ne manquez pas aussitôt de me le venir proposer, je vous en résoudrai les difficultés.		
A845	il me répondit que ce méchant [notes de musique] et nommé du peuple par une chiquenaude sur le genou droit, qui avait été convaincu d'envie et d'ingratitude, était décédé le jour précédent,		
A846	Maintenant, afin que vous sachiez pourquoi en ce pays tout le monde a le nez grand, apprenez qu'aussitôt que la femme est accouchée, la matrone porte l'enfant au maître du Séminaire; et justement, au bout de l'an, les experts étant assemblés, si son nez est trouvé plus court qu'à une certaine mesure que tient le Syndic, il est censé camus et mis entre les mains de gens qui le châtrent. Vous me demanderez la cause de cette barbarie, et comment il peut se faire que nous, chez qui la virginité est un crime, établissons des continences par force? Mais sachez que nous le faisons après avoir observé, depuis trente siècles, qu'un grand nez est le signe d'un homme spirituel, courtois, affable, généreux, libéral; et que le petit est un signe du contraire. C'est pourquoi des Camus on bâtit les Eunuques, parce que la République aime mieux ne pas avoir d'enfants que d'en avoir qui leur fussent semblables.		
A847	Les femelles ici, non plus que les mâles, ne sont pas assez ingrates pour rougir à la vue de celui qui les a forgées; et les vierges n'ont pas honte d'aimer sur nous, en mémoire de leur mère Nature, la seule chose qui porte son nom.		
A848	O mon petit homme! s'écria-t-il, quoi! les grands de votre Monde sont si enragés de faire parade d'un grand instrument qui désigne un bourreau, qui n'est forgé que pour nous détruire, enfin l'ennemi juré de tout ce qui vit;		
A849	Sachez que ces noms-là diffament le nom de Philosophe, et que, comme le Sage ne voit rien au monde qu'il ne conçoive et qu'il ne juge pouvoir être conçu, il doit abhorrer toutes ces expressions de prodiges et d'événements de Nature, qu'ont inventés les stupides, pour excuser les faiblesses de leur entendement.		
A850	Vous le dites, continua-t-il; mais vous ne savez pas que la force de l'imagination est capable de guérir toutes les maladies que vous attribuez au surnaturel,		
A851	Il s'en alla ensuite et me laissa dans l'admiration des gens de ce Monde-là, dans lesquels, jusqu'au simple peuple, il se trouve naturellement tant d'esprit, au lieu que ceux du nôtre en ont si peu, et qui leur coûte si cher.		
A852	Soyez, soyez, je vous prie, plus crédule en ma faveur.		
A853	_Pour me purger de ce mauvais air, je m'exposais tout nu au soleil dessus une terrasse,		
A854	de sorte que, les yeux noyés dans ce grand Astre, tantôt l'un le prenait pour une lucarne du Ciel; tantôt un autre assurait que c'était la platine où Diane dresse les rabats d'Apollon; un autre, que ce pouvait bien être le Soleil lui-même, qui, s'étant au soir dépouillé de ses rayons, regardait par un trou ce qu'on faisait au monde, quand il n'y était pas.		
A855	je crois, sans m'amuser aux imaginations pointues dont vous chatouillez le Temps pour le faire marcher plus vite, que la Lune est un monde comme celui-ci; à qui le nôtre sert de Lune		
A856	Mais j'eus beau leur alléguer que _Pythagore_, _Epicure_, _Démocrite et de notre âge Copernic et Keppler_[4] avaient été de cette opinion		
A857	je pris toute cette enchaînure d'incidents pour une inspiration de faire connaître aux hommes que la Lune est un monde		
A858	J'avais attaché autour de moi quantité de fioles pleines de rosée, sur lesquelles le Soleil dardait ses rayons si violemment, que la chaleur, qui les attirait, comme elle fait les plus grosses nuées, m'éleva si haut, qu'enfin je me trouvai au-dessus de la moyenne région		
A859	je lui dis qu'il fallait que la Terre eût tourné pendant mon élévation, puisque, ayant commencé de monter à deux lieues de Paris, j'étais tombé, par une ligne quasi-perpendiculaire, en Canada.		
A860	je lui dis qu'il fallait que la Terre eût tourné pendant mon élévation, puisque, ayant commencé de monter à deux lieues de Paris, j'étais tombé, par une ligne quasi-perpendiculaire, en Canada		
A861	je vous dirai franchement que ce qui fait que je ne suis pas de votre opinion, c'est qu'encore qu'hier vous soyez parti de Paris, vous pouvez être arrivé aujourd'hui en cette contrée, sans que la Terre ait tourné		
A862	je vous dirai franchement que ce qui fait que je ne suis pas de votre opinion		
A863	puisque, selon Ptolémée, Tycho Brahé et les philosophes modernes, il chemine du biais que vous faites marcher la Terre		
A864	Je ne vous reproche point vos excentèques, ni vos épicicles, lesquels vous ne sauriez expliquer que très confusément, et dont je sauve mon système		
A865	Vous êtes contraints, vous autres, de recourir aux intelligences qui remuent et gouvernent vos globes?		
A866	les raisons qu'allègue Copernic		
A867	non point pour les raisons qu'allègue Copernic, mais parce que, le feu d'enfer _ainsi que vous apprend la Sainte-Ecriture_, étant enclos au centre de la terre, les damnés, qui veulent fuir l'ardeur de sa flamme, gravissent, pour s'en éloigner, contre la voûte, et font ainsi tourner la Terre, comme un chien fait tourner une roue, lorsqu'il court enfermé dedans.		
A868	les hommes, tournant avec la Terre autour du Ciel, ont cru que c'était le Ciel lui-même qui tournait autour d'eux.		
A869	je crois que les Planètes sont des mondes autour du Soleil, et que les étoiles fixes sont aussi des Soleils qui ont des Planètes autour d'eux		
A870	qui d'ici paraissent des taches, sont des mondes qui se construisent.		
A871	m'obliger de vous confesser que mon raisonnement le   cédera toujours en ces sortes de choses à la Foi.		
A872	Nous eûmes, le lendemain et les jours suivants, des entretiens de pareille nature		
A873	J'avais fait une machine que je m'imaginais capable de m'élever autant que je voudrais,		
A874	Je connus bien à la vérité que je ne retombais pas vers notre monde		
A875	il ne m'avait plus paru que comme une grande plaque d'or		
A876	et je me confirmai dans cette opinion,		
A877	J'ai souvent fait depuis réflexion sur ce que le vulgaire assure qu'en se précipitant d'un lieu fort haut, on est étouffé avant de toucher la terre; et j'ai conclu, de mon aventure, qu'il en avait menti		
A878	ce que vous dites est véritable; cette terre-ci est la Lune, que vous voyez de votre globe		
A879	chacun d'eux crut que c'était un canton de la terre qui n'avait pas été noyé		
A880	mes compagnons et moi perdîmes tout le plaisir que nous avions autrefois pris à l'instruire.		
A881	conversé avec des personnes		
A882	j'ai enseigné quantité de souplesses et de secrets naturels, qui sans doute les auront fait passer pour de Grands Magiciens		
A883	mais il les refusa avec un dédain plus généreux que Diogène ne reçut les compliments d'Alexandre		
A884	le seul homme libre		
A885	que les Philosophes ne se laissent persuader qu'à la raison et que l'autorité d'un savant, ni le plus grand nombre, ne l'emportent point sur l'opinion d'un batteur en grange, quand il raisonne aussi fortement		
A886	et que c'était sans doute ce qui avait fait penser à beaucoup de monde que les histoires qui se contaient d'eux n'étaient qu'un effet de la rêverie des faibles, à cause qu'ils n'apparaissent que de nuit		
A887	il y a dans l'univers un million peut-être de choses, qui, pour être connues, demanderaient en vous un million d'organes tous différents		
A888	me faisaient passer sans ennui les violences de ma captivité.		
A889	je viens moi-même d'en expérimenter quelque chose		
A890	la police judicieuse de ce pays-là,		
A891	notre entretien était un grognement que la joie d'être rejoints, par un instinct naturel, nous faisait bourdonner.		
A892	la dignité de notre nation, en faveur de qui l'univers ne produit des hommes que pour nous donner des esclaves

A895	car nous n'aimions guère ni l'un ni l'autre à nous entretenir des choses basses		
A896	ceux qui tenaient pour moi demandèrent une assemblée des Etats, pour résoudre cette controverse.

A901	car, encore que nous voyions de l'eau, de la terre, de l'air et du feu séparés, on ne les trouve jamais pourtant si parfaitement purs, qu'ils ne soient encore engagés les uns avec les autres		
A902	Quand, par exemple, vous regardez du feu, ce n'est pas du feu, ce n'est que de l'eau beaucoup étendue; l'air n'est que de l'eau fort dilatée; l'eau n'est que de la terre qui se fond, et la terre elle-même n'est autre chose que de l'eau beaucoup resserrée;		
A903	e ne pus m'empêcher de rire de cette façon scrupuleuse de donner des batailles; et j'alléguais, pour exemple d'une bien plus forte politique, les coutumes de notre Europe, où le Monarque n'avait garde d'omettre aucun de ses avantages pour vaincre

A912	j'avais osé dire que la Lune d'où je venais était un Monde, et que leur Monde n'était qu'une Lune, crurent que cela leur fournissait un prétexte assez juste pour me faire condamner à l'eau: c'est la façon d'exterminer les impies.		
A913	c'était une trompette qu'il avait tout exprès choisie, afin que la violence de ce son martial échauffât leurs esprits à ma mort, et afin d'empêcher par cette émotion que le raisonnement ne pût faire son office, comme il arrive dans nos armées, où le tintamarre des trompettes et des tambours empêche le soldat de réfléchir sur l'importance de sa vie.

A942	des gens de ce Monde-là, dans lesquels, jusqu'au simple peuple, il se trouve naturellement tant d'esprit, au lieu que ceux du nôtre en ont si peu, et qui leur coûte si cher.		
A943	Il y avoit longtemps que nous ne parlions plus des mondes, Madame L.M.D.G. et moi,		
A944	j’allai un jour chez elle, et y entrai justement comme deux hommes d’esprit		
A945	je vous avouerai qu’elle m’a laissée avec quelque soupçon que vous pourriez bien m’avoir gâté l’esprit.		
A946	Je ne sais comment la conversation s’est tournée sur les mondes, avec ces deux hommes qui viennent de sortir ; peut-être ont-ils amené ce discours malicieusement.		
A947	moi, avec toute la naïveté possible, je lui ai soutenu que je le croyois		
A948	L’un d’eux m’a dit qu’il étoit fort persuadé que je ne le croyois pas ; moi, avec toute la naïveté possible, je lui ai soutenu que je le croyois		
A949	il a toujours pris cela pour une feinte d’une personne qui vouloit se divertir, et j’ai cru que ce qui le rendoit si opiniâtre à ne me pas croire moi même sur mes sentimens, c’est qu’il m’estimoit trop pour s’imaginer que je fusse capable d’une opinion si extravagante.		
A950	il m’estimoit trop pour s’imaginer que je fusse capable d’une opinion si extravagante.		
A951	il a toujours pris cela pour une feinte d’une personne qui vouloit se divertir, et j’ai cru que ce qui le rendoit si opiniâtre à ne me pas croire moi même sur mes sentimens, c’est qu’il m’estimoit trop pour s’imaginer que je fusse capable d’une opinion si extravagante. Pour l’autre, qui ne m’estime pas tant, il m’a crue sur ma parole.		
A952	Pourquoi m’avez-vous entêtée d’une chose que les gens qui m’estiment ne peuvent pas croire que je soutienne sérieusement ?		
A953	Mais, Madame, lui répondis-je, pourquoi la souteniez-vous sérieusement avec des gens que je suis sûr qui n’entroient dans aucun raisonnement qui fût un peu sérieux ?		
A954	Contentons-nous d’être une petite troupe choisie qui les croyons, et ne divulguons pas nos mystères dans le peuple.		
A955	Ils ont bien de l’esprit, répliquai-je, mais ils ne raisonnent jamais.		
A956	Les raisonneurs, qui sont gens durs, les appelleront peuple sans difficulté.		
A957	D’autre part ces gens-ci s’en vengent en tournant les raisonneurs en ridicules, et c’est, ce me semble,		
A958	il eût bien mieux valu plaisanter des habitants des planètes avec ces deux hommes que vous venez de voir, puisqu’ils savent plaisanter, que d’en raisonner, puisqu’ils ne le savent pas faire.		
A959	Trahir la vérité ! dit la Marquise. Vous n’avez point de conscience.		
A960	je n’ai pas un grand zèle pour ces vérités-là, et que je les sacrifie volontiers aux moindres commodités de la société.		
A961	Je vois, par exemple, à quoi il tient, et à quoi il tiendra toujours, que l’opinion des habitants des planètes ne passe pour aussi vraisemblable qu’elle l’est ; les planètes se présentent toujours aux yeux comme des corps qui jettent de la lumière, et non point comme de grandes campagnes ou de grandes prairies ; nous croirions bien que des prairies et des campagnes seroient habitées, mais des corps lumineux, il n’y a pas moyen. La raison a beau venir nous dire qu’il y a dans les planètes des campagnes, des prairies, la raison vient trop tard, le premier coup d’œil a fait son effet sur nous avant elle, nous ne la voulons plus écouter, les planètes ne sont que des corps lumineux ;		
A962	La raison a beau venir nous dire qu’il y a dans les planètes des campagnes, des prairies, la raison vient trop tard,		
A963	le premier coup d’œil a fait son effet sur nous avant elle,		
A964	Il faudroit que notre imagination nous représentât aussitôt leurs figures, elle ne le peut pas ; c’est le plus court de croire qu’ils ne sont point.		
A965	Voudriez-vous que pour établir les habitants des planètes, dont les intérêts me touchent d’assez loin, j’allasse attaquer ces redoutables puissances qu’on appelle les sens et l’imagination ?		
A966	Voudriez-vous que pour établir les habitants des planètes, dont les intérêts me touchent d’assez loin, j’allasse attaquer ces redoutables puissances qu’on appelle les sens et l’imagination ? Il faudroit bien du courage pour cette entreprise ; on ne persuade pas facilement aux hommes de mettre leur raison en la place de leurs yeux.		
A967	Je vois quelquefois bien des gens assez raisonnables pour vouloir bien croire, après mille preuves, que les planètes sont des Terres ; mais ils ne le croient pas de la même façon qu’ils le croiroient s’ils ne les avoient pas vues sous une apparence différente, il leur souvient toujours de la première idée qu’ils en ont prise, et ils n’en reviennent pas bien. Ce sont ces gens-là qui, en croyant notre opinion, semblent cependant lui faire grâce, et ne la favoriser qu’à cause d’un certain plaisir que leur fait sa singularité.		
A968	mais ils ne le croient pas de la même façon qu’ils le croiroient s’ils ne les avoient pas vues sous une apparence différente,		
A969	Eh quoi, interrompit-elle, n’en est-ce pas assez pour une opinion qui n’est que vraisemblable ? Vous seriez bien étonnée, repris-je, si je vous disois que le terme de vraisemblable est assez modeste. Est-il simplement vraisemblable qu’Alexandre ait été ? Vous vous en tenez fort sûre, et sur quoi est fondée cette certitude ? Sur ce que vous en avez toutes les preuves que vous pouvez souhaiter en pareille matière, et qu’il ne se présente pas le moindre sujet de douter, qui suspende et qui arrête votre esprit ; car, du reste, vous n’avez jamais vu Alexandre, et vous n’avez pas de démonstration mathématique qu’il ait dû être ; mais que diriez-vous si les habitants des planètes étoient à peu près dans le même cas ? On ne sauroit vous les faire voir, et vous ne pouvez pas demander qu’on vous les démontre comme l’on feroit une affaire de mathématique ; mais toutes les preuves qu’on peut souhaiter d’une pareille chose, vous les avez,		
A970	vous ne sauriez imaginer le moindre sujet de doute, si vous ne reprenez les yeux et l’esprit du peuple.		
A971	Enfin supposez qu’ils soient, ces habitants des planètes, ils ne sauroient se déclarer par plus de marques, et par des marques plus sensibles, après cela, c’est à vous à voir si vous ne les voulez traiter que de chose purement vraisemblable.		
A972	Enfin supposez qu’ils soient, ces habitants des planètes, ils ne sauroient se déclarer par plus de marques, et par des marques plus sensibles, après cela, c’est à vous à voir si vous ne les voulez traiter que de chose purement vraisemblable. Mais vous ne voudriez pas, reprit-elle, que cela me parût aussi certain qu’il me le paraît qu’Alexandre a été ? Non pas tout à fait, répondis-je ; car quoique nous ayons sur les habitants des planètes autant de preuves que nous en pouvons avoir dans la situation où nous sommes, le nombre de ces preuves n’est pourtant pas grand.		
A973	que diriez-vous si les habitants des planètes étoient à peu près dans le même cas ? On ne sauroit vous les faire voir, et vous ne pouvez pas demander qu’on vous les démontre comme l’on feroit une affaire de mathématique ; mais toutes les preuves qu’on peut souhaiter d’une pareille chose, vous les avez,		
A974	Les horloges les plus communes et les plus grossières marquent les heures, il n’y a que celles qui sont travaillées avec plus d’art qui marquent les minutes.		
A975	De même les esprits ordinaires sentent bien la différence d’une simple vraisemblance à une certitude entière ; mais il n’y a que les esprits fins qui sentent le plus ou le moins de certitude ou de vraisemblance, et qui en marquent, pour ainsi dire, les minutes par leur sentiment.		
A976	Je suis sûr que vous ne croyez pas le mouvement de la Terre autant qu’il devroit être cru, en êtes-vous beaucoup à plaindre ? Oh ! pour cela, reprit-elle, j’en fais bien mon devoir, vous n’avez rien à me reprocher, je crois fermement que la Terre tourne. Je ne vous ai pourtant pas dit la meilleure raison qui le prouve, répliquai-je. Ah ! s’écria-t- elle. C’est une trahison de m’avoir fait croire les choses avec de faibles preuves. Vous ne me jugiez donc pas digne de croire sur de bonnes raisons ?		
A977	Je ne vous prouvois les choses, répondis-je, qu’avec de petits raisonnemens doux, et accommodés à votre usage ; en eussé-je employé d’aussi solides et d’aussi robustes que si j’avois eu à attaquer un Docteur ? Oui, dit-elle, prenez-moi présentement pour un Docteur, et voyons cette nouvelle preuve du mouvement de la Terre.		
A978	Volontiers, repris-je, la voici. Elle me plaît fort, peut-être parce que je crois l’avoir trouvée ; cependant elle est si bonne et si naturelle, que je n’oserois m’assurer d’en être l’inventeur.		
A979	Mais qu’ils aient réellement cette révolution de vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre, c’est bien la chose du monde où il y a le moins d’apparence, quoique l’absurdité n’en saute pas d’abord aux yeux.		
A980	Il faut, ou que tous les corps célestes tournent en vingt quatre heures autour de la Terre, ou que la Terre tournant sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures attribue ce mouvement à tous les corps célestes.		
A981	Je vous entends, interrompit la Marquise, et je crois que vous avez raison. Oui, je suis de votre avis ; si les planètes tournoient autour de la Terre, elles tourneroient en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances, ainsi qu’elles font autour du Soleil ; n’est-ce pas ce que vous voulez dire ?		
A982	leurs distances inégales à l’égard de la Terre devroient produire des différences dans ce mouvement prétendu autour de la Terre ; et les étoiles fixes, qui sont si prodigieusement éloignées de nous, si fort élevées au-dessus de tout ce qui pourroit prendre autour de nous un mouvement général, du moins situées en lieu où ce mouvement devroit être fort affaibli, n’y aurait-il pas bien de l’apparence qu’elles ne tourneroient pas autour de nous en vingt-quatre heures, comme la Lune qui en est si proche ?		
A983	et les étoiles fixes, qui sont si prodigieusement éloignées de nous, si fort élevées au-dessus de tout ce qui pourroit prendre autour de nous un mouvement général, du moins situées en lieu où ce mouvement devroit être fort affaibli, n’y aurait-il pas bien de l’apparence qu’elles ne tourneroient pas autour de nous en vingt-quatre heures,		
A984	Les comètes, qui sont étrangères dans notre tourbillon, qui y tiennent des routes si différentes, ne devraient-elles pas être dispensées de tourner toutes autour de nous dans ce même temps de vingt-quatre heures ? Mais non, planètes, étoiles fixes, comètes, tout tournera en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre. Encore, s’il y avait dans ces mouvemens quelques minutes de différence, on pourroit s’en contenter ; mais ils seront tous de la plus exacte égalité, ou plutôt de la seule égalité exacte qui soit au monde ; pas une minute de plus ou de moins. En vérité, cela doit être étrangement suspect.		
A985	Oh ! dit la Marquise, puisqu’il est possible que cette grande égalité ne soit que dans notre imagination, je me tiens fort sûre qu’elle n’est point hors de là. Je suis bien aise qu’une chose qui n’est point du génie de la nature retombe entièrement sur nous, et qu’elle en soit déchargée, quoique ce soit à nos dépens.		
A986	Et nos pendules ne marquent-elles pas une entière égalité ? Oh ! répondis-je, je récuse les pendules ; elles ne peuvent pas elles-mêmes être tout à fait justes, et quelquefois qu’elles le seront, en marquant qu’un tour de vingt-quatre heures sera plus long ou plus court qu’un autre, on aimera mieux les croire déréglées que de soupçonner la Terre de quelque irrégularité dans ses révolutions.		
A987	Ne pourrait-elle pas peu à peu s’approcher du Soleil ? Et alors se trouvant dans un endroit où la matière seroit plus agitée, et le mouvement plus rapide, elle feroit en moins de temps sa double révolution et autour du Soleil, et autour d’elle-même. Les années seroient plus courtes, et les jours aussi, ainsi on ne pourroit s’en apercevoir, parce qu’on ne laisseroit pas de partager toujours les années en trois cent soixante-cinq jours, et les jours en vingt-quatre heures.		
A988	J’en conviens, répondis-je ; la conduite de la nature n’est pas brusque, et sa méthode est d’amener tout par des degrés qui ne sont sensibles que dans les changemens fort prompts et fort aisés. Nous ne sommes presque capables de nous apercevoir que de celui des saisons ; pour les autres, qui se font avec une certaine lenteur, ils ne manquent guère de nous échapper.		
A989	Ne semble-t-il pas, dit-elle, qu’il y ait une destinée malicieuse qui en veuille particulièrement à la beauté ? Ç’a été justement cette Demoiselle qu’elle a été attaquer sur toute la Lune.		
A990	Nos Astronomes voient sur la Lune des visages de demoiselles, il pourroit être que des femmes, qui observeraient, y verroient de beaux visages d’hommes.		
A991	qui marquent nécessairement que l’eau les a autrefois couvertes.		
A992	Les fables ne sont point tout à fait des fables, ce sont des histoires des temps reculés, mais qui ont été défigurées, ou par l’ignorance des peuples, ou par l’amour qu’ils avoient pour le merveilleux,		
A993	que du temps de quelque Hercule, car il y en a cinquante, l’Océan ait enfoncé deux montagnes plus faibles que les autres, peut-être à l’aide de quelque tremblement de terre, et se soit jeté entre l’Europe et l’Afrique, je le croirois sans beaucoup de peine.		
A994	Cela ne seroit encore rien, repris-je, en comparaison de ce qui se passe dans Jupiter. Il paraît sur sa surface comme des bandes, dont il seroit enveloppé, et que l’on distingue les unes des autres, ou des intervalles qui sont entre elles, par les différens degrés de clarté ou d’obscurité. Ce sont des terres et des mers, ou enfin de grandes parties de la surface de Jupiter, aussi différentes entre elles. tantôt ces bandes s’étrécissent, tantôt elles s’élargissent ; elles s’interrompent quelquefois, et se réunissent ensuite ; il s’en forme de nouvelles en divers endroits, et il s’en efface, et tous ces changemens, qui ne sont sensibles qu’à nos meilleures lunettes, sont en eux-mêmes beaucoup plus considérables que si notre Océan inondoit toute la terre ferme, et laissoit en sa place de nouveaux continens.		
A995	ous ces changemens, qui ne sont sensibles qu’à nos meilleures lunettes,		
A996	Mais enfin depuis trente ans on l’a démêlée sûrement, et elle a fait quelque temps les délices des astronomes, dont la curiosité avoit besoin d’être réveillée par quelque chose d’une espèce nouvelle		
A997	les deux dernières lunes de Saturne, par exemple, ne les ont pas charmés ni ravis, comme avoient fait les satellites ou les lunes de Jupiter ; on s’accoutume à tout.		
A998	On la voit avant le lever du soleil, et avant le crépuscule vers l’équinoxe de Septembre, et on la voit soir et matin vers le solstice d’hiver ; hors de là elle ne peut, comme je viens de vous dire, se dégager des crépuscules, qui ont trop de force et de durée ; car on suppose qu’elle subsiste toujours et l’apparence y est tout entière. On commence à conjecturer qu’elle est produite par quelque grand amas de matière un peu épaisse qui environne le Soleil jusqu’à une certaine étendue.		
A999	Je croirois assez volontiers que la nature, selon le penchant que je lui connois à l’économie, ne se seroit servie que de ce seul moyen. Cependant, répliquai-je, malgré cette économie, il y auroit à l’égard de notre Terre deux causes de crépuscules, dont l’une, qui est l’air épais du Soleil, seroit assez inutile,		
A1000	ne pourroit être qu’un objet de curiosité pour les habitants de l’observatoire		
A1001	mais il faut tout dire, il se peut qu’il n’y ait que la Terre qui pousse hors de soi des vapeurs et des exhalaisons assez grossières pour produire des crépuscules, et la nature aura eu raison de pourvoir par un moyen général aux besoins de toutes les autres planètes, qui seront, pour ainsi dire, plus pures, et dont les évaporations seront plus subtiles. Nous sommes peut-être ceux d’entre tous les habitants des mondes de notre tourbillon à qui il falloit donner à respirer l’air le plus grossier et le plus épais. Avec quel mépris nous regarderoient les habitants des autres planètes, s’ils savoient cela !		
A1002	Ils auroient tort, dit la Marquise, on n’est pas à mépriser pour être enveloppé d’un air épais, puisque le Soleil lui-même en a un qui l’enveloppe.		
A1003	Voilà, Madame, répondis-je, un petit commencement de système que vous avez fait assez heureusement.		
A1004	Il n’y a rien qu’on ne doive présumer de l’adresse de la nature ; mais elle a une autre sorte d’adresse toute particulière pour se dérober à nous, et on ne doit pas s’assurer aisément d’avoir deviné sa manière d’agir, ni ses desseins.		
A1005	En fait des découvertes nouvelles, il ne se faut pas trop presser de raisonner, quoiqu’on en ait toujours assez d’envie, et les vrais philosophes sont comme les éléphants, qui en marchant ne posent jamais le second pied à terre, que le premier n’y soit bien affermi.		
A1006	Je viens de vous dire, répondis-je, toutes les nouvelles que je sais du ciel, et je ne crois pas qu’il y en ait de plus fraîches. Je suis bien fâché qu’elles ne soient pas aussi sur prenantes et aussi merveilleuses que quelques observations que je lisois l’autre jour dans un abrégé des Annales de la Chine, écrit en latin.		
A1007	Je suis bien fâché qu’elles ne soient pas aussi sur prenantes et aussi merveilleuses que quelques observations que je lisois l’autre jour dans un abrégé des Annales de la Chine, écrit en latin.		
A1008	Cela n’a pas été vu pour une fois à la Chine,		
A1009	j’ai trouvé cette observation en deux temps assez éloignés,		
A1010	Il n’y a pas longtemps que tous nos philosophes se croyoient fondés en expérience pour soutenir que les cieux et tous les corps célestes étoient incorruptibles, et incapables de changement, et pendant ce temps-là d’autres hommes à l’autre bout de la Terre voyoient des étoiles se dissoudre par milliers, cela est assez différent.		
A1011	En vérité je crois toujours, de plus en plus, qu’il y a un certain génie qui n’a point encore été hors de notre Europe, ou qui du moins ne s’en est pas beaucoup éloigné. Peut-être qu’il ne lui est pas permis de se répandre dans une grande étendue de terre à la fois, et que quelque fatalité lui prescrit des bornes assez étroites. Jouissons-en tandis que nous le possédons ; ce qu’il a de meilleur, c’est qu’il ne se renferme pas dans les sciences et dans les spéculations sèches, il s’étend avec autant de succès jusqu’aux choses d’agrément, sur lesquelles je doute qu’aucun peuple nous égale. Ce sont celles-là, Madame, auxquelles il vous appartient de vous occuper, et qui doivent composer toute votre philosophie.		
A1012	comme les Grecs et les Romains à en être séparés par une longue suite de siècles, tout éloignement est en droit de nous imposer.		
A1013	Trahir la vérité		
A1014	Vous n’avez point de conscience.		
A1015	Je vous avoue, répondis-je, que je n’ai pas un grand zèle pour ces vérités-là		
A1016	on ne persuade pas facilement aux hommes de mettre leur raison en la place de leurs yeux		
A1017	Les horloges les plus communes et les plus grossières marquent les heures, il n’y a que celles qui sont travaillées avec plus d’art qui marquent les minutes. De même les esprits ordinaires sentent bien la différence d’une simple vraisemblance à une certitude entière ; mais il n’y a que les esprits fins qui sentent le plus ou le moins de certitude ou de vraisemblance, et qui en marquent, pour ainsi dire, les minutes par leur sentiment.		
A1018	Il n’y a pas longtemps que tous nos philosophes se croyoient fondés en expérience pour soutenir que les cieux et tous les corps célestes étoient incorruptibles, et incapables de changement, et pendant ce temps-là d’autres hommes à l’autre bout de la Terre voyoient des étoiles se dissoudre par milliers		
A1019	Contentons-nous d’être une petite troupe choisie qui les croyons, et ne divulguons pas nos mystères dans le peuple		
A1020	La raison a beau venir nous dire qu’il y a dans les planètes des campagnes, des prairies, la raison vient trop tard, le premier coup d’œil a fait son effet sur nous avant elle, nous ne la voulons plus écouter, les planètes ne sont que des corps lumineux		
A1021	Vous vous en tenez fort sûre, et sur quoi est fondée cette certitude ?		
A1022	car, du reste, vous n’avez jamais vu Alexandre, et vous n’avez pas de démonstration mathématique qu’il ait dû être ; mais que diriez-vous si les habitants des planètes étoient à peu près dans le même cas ?		
A1023	On ne sauroit vous les faire voir, et vous ne pouvez pas demander qu’on vous les démontre comme l’on feroit une affaire de mathématique ; mais toutes les preuves qu’on peut souhaiter d’une pareille chose, vous les avez,		
A1024	ils ne sont pas tout à fait certains, ils sont plus que vraisemblables, cela m’embarrasse trop		
A1025	Vous ne me jugiez donc pas digne de croire sur de bonnes raisons ?		
A1026	Oui, dit-elle, prenez-moi présentement pour un Docteur, et voyons cette nouvelle preuve du mouvement de la Terre.		
A1027	Elle me plaît fort, peut-être parce que je crois l’avoir trouvée ; cependant elle est si bonne et si naturelle, que je n’oserois m’assurer d’en être l’inventeur.		
A1028	on ne sait pas bien sur quoi se règle cette inégalité, si c’est ou sur la différente grosseur des planètes, ou sur leur différente solidité, ou sur la différente vitesse des tourbillons particuliers qui les enferment, et des matières liquides où elles sont portées, mais enfin l’inégalité est très certaine et, en général, tel est l’ordre de la nature, que tout ce qui est commun à plusieurs choses se trouve en même temps varié par des différences particulières		
A1029	et les étoiles fixes, qui sont si prodigieusement éloignées de nous, si fort élevées au-dessus de tout ce qui pourroit prendre autour de nous un mouvement général, du moins situées en lieu où ce mouvement devroit être fort affaibli, n’y aurait-il pas bien de l’apparence qu’elles ne tourneroient pas autour de nous en vingt-quatre heures, comme la Lune qui en est si proche ?		
A1030	Les comètes, qui sont étrangères dans notre tourbillon, qui y tiennent des routes si différentes, ne devraient-elles pas être dispensées de tourner toutes autour de nous dans ce même temps de vingt-quatre heures ?		
A1031	Mais non, planètes, étoiles fixes, comètes, tout tournera en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre		
A1032	Encore, s’il y avait dans ces mouvemens quelques minutes de différence, on pourroit s’en contenter ; mais ils seront tous de la plus exacte égalité, ou plutôt de la seule égalité exacte qui soit au monde ; pas une minute de plus ou de moins.		
A1033	Oh ! dit la Marquise, puisqu’il est possible que cette grande égalité ne soit que dans notre imagination, je me tiens fort sûre qu’elle n’est point hors de là.		
A1034	Je vous entends, interrompit la Marquise, et je crois que vous avez raison.		
A1035	récompense		
A1036	j’entends quelque visage à la manière de la Lune, car chacun transporte sur les objets les idées dont il est rempli		
A1037	Il y a beaucoup d’apparence, répondis-je, qu’il en est arrivé.		
A1038	on aimera mieux les croire déréglées que de soupçonner la Terre de quelque irrégularité dans ses révolutions		
A1039	Les fables ne sont point tout à fait des fables, ce sont des histoires des temps reculés, mais qui ont été défigurées, ou par l’ignorance des peuples, ou par l’amour qu’ils avoient pour le merveilleux, très anciennes maladies des hommes		
A1040	il s’en forme de nouvelles en divers endroits, et il s’en efface, et tous ces changemens, qui ne sont sensibles qu’à nos meilleures lunettes, sont en eux-mêmes beaucoup plus considérables que si notre Océan inondoit toute la terre ferme, et laissoit en sa place de nouveaux continens. À moins que les habitants de Jupiter ne soient amphibies, et qu’ils ne vivent également sur la terre et dans l’eau, je ne sais pas trop bien ce qu’ils deviennen		
A1041	Mais enfin depuis trente ans on l’a démêlée sûrement, et elle a fait quelque temps les délices des astronomes, dont la curiosité avoit besoin d’être réveillée par quelque chose d’une espèce nouvelle ; ils eussent eu beau découvrir de nouvelles planètes subalternes, ils n’en étoient presque plus touchés ; les deux dernières lunes de Saturne, par exemple, ne les ont pas charmés ni ravis, comme avoient fait les satellites ou les lunes de Jupiter ; on s’accoutume à tout.		
A1042	car on suppose qu’elle subsiste toujours et l’apparence y est tout entière. On commence à conjecturer qu’elle est produite par quelque grand amas de matière un peu épaisse qui environne le Soleil jusqu’à une certaine étendue.		
A1043	Sur ce pied-là, je dois me dédire de ce que je vous avois dit, que la Lune ne devoit point avoir de crépuscules, faute d’être environnée d’un air épais ainsi que la Terre		
A1044	l’une, qui est l’air épais du Soleil, seroit assez inutile, et ne pourroit être qu’un objet de curiosité pour les habitants de l’observatoire		
A1045	Nous sommes peut-être ceux d’entre tous les habitants des mondes de notre tourbillon à qui il falloit donner à respirer l’air le plus grossier et le plus épais. Avec quel mépris nous regarderoient les habitants des autres planètes, s’ils savoient cela !		
A1046	Ils auroient tort, dit la Marquise, on n’est pas à mépriser pour être enveloppé d’un air épais, puisque le Soleil lui-même en a un qui l’enveloppe		
A1047	Il n’y a rien qu’on ne doive présumer de l’adresse de la nature ; mais elle a une autre sorte d’adresse toute particulière pour se dérober à nous, et on ne doit pas s’assurer aisément d’avoir deviné sa manière d’agir, ni ses desseins		
A1048	ce qu’il a de meilleur, c’est qu’il ne se renferme pas dans les sciences et dans les spéculations sèches, il s’étend avec autant de succès jusqu’aux choses d’agrément, sur lesquelles je doute qu’aucun peuple nous égale.		
A1049	Ce sont celles-là, Madame, auxquelles il vous appartient de vous occuper, et qui doivent composer toute votre philosophie.		
A1050	Io scopersi pochi anni a dietro, come ben sa l’Altezza Vostra Serenissima, molti particolari nel cielo, stati invisibili sino a questa età		
A1051	li quali, sì per la novità, sì per alcune conseguenze che da essi dependono, contrarianti ad alcune proposizioni naturali comunemente ricevute dalle scuole de i filosofi, mi eccitorno contro non piccol numero di tali professori		
A1052	quasi che io di mia mano avessi tali cose collocate in cielo, per intorbidar la natura e le scienze.		
A1053	E scordatisi in certo modo che la moltitudine de’ veri concorre all’investigazione, accrescimento e stabilimento delle discipline, e non alla diminuzione o destruzione,		
A1054	dimostrandosi nell’istesso tempo più affezionati alle proprie opinioni che alle vere,		
A1055	scorsero a negare e far prova d’annullare quelle novità, delle quali il senso istesso, quando avessero voluto con attenzione riguardarle, gli averebbe potuti render sicuri; e per questo produssero varie cose, ed alcune scritture pubblicarono ripiene di vani discorsi, e, quel che fu più grave errore, sparse di attestazioni delle Sacre Scritture,		
A1056	tolte da luoghi non bene da loro intesi e lontano dal proposito addotti: nel quale errore forse non sarebbono incorsi, se avessero avvertito un utilissimo documento che ci dà S. Agostino intorno all’andar con riguardo nel determinar resolutamente sopra le cose oscure e difficili ad esser comprese per via del solo discorso; mentre, parlando pur di certa conclusione naturale attenente a i corpi celesti, scrive così: «Nunc autem, servata semper moderatione piæ gravitatis, nihil credere de re obscura temere debemus, ne forte quod postea veritas patefecerit, quamvis libris sanctis, sive Testamenti Veteris sive Novi, nullo modo esse possit adversum, tamen propter amorem nostri errori oderimus.».		
A1057	parlando pur di certa conclusione naturale attenente a i corpi celesti, scrive così: «Nunc autem, servata semper moderatione piæ gravitatis, nihil credere de re obscura temere debemus, ne forte quod postea veritas patefecerit, quamvis libris sanctis, sive Testamenti Veteris sive Novi, nullo modo esse possit adversum, tamen propter amorem nostri errori oderimus.».		
A1058	conclusione naturale attenente a i corpi celesti,		
A1059	molti particolari nel cielo, stati invisibili sino a questa età		
A1060	È accaduto poi che il tempo è andato successivamente scoprendo a tutti le verità prima da me additate,		
A1061	e con la verità del fatto		
A1062	la diversità degli animi tra quelli che schiettamente e senz’altro livore non ammettevano per veri tali scoprimenti, e quegli che all’incredulità aggiugnevano qualche effetto alterato		
A1063	come i più intendenti della scienza astronomica e della naturale restarono persuasi al mio primo avviso,		
A1064	così si sono andati quietando di grado in grado gli altri tutti che non venivano mantenuti in negativa o in dubbio da altro che dall’inaspettata novità e dal non aver avuta occasione di vederne sensate esperienze		
A1065	quelli che, oltre all’amor del primo errore, non saprei qual altro loro immaginato interesse gli rende non bene affetti non tanto verso le cose quanto verso l’autore, quelle, non le potendo più negare, cuoprono sotto un continuo silenzio, e divertendo il pensiero ad altre fantasie, inacerbiti più che prima da quello onde gli altri si sono addolciti e quietati, tentano di progiudicarmi con altri modi.		
A1066	tentano di progiudicarmi con altri modi.		
A1067	le nuove calunnie e persecuzioni non terminano nella molta o poca dottrina, nella quale io scarsamente pretendo, ma si estendono a tentar di offendermi con macchie che devono essere e sono da me più aborrite che la morte,		
A1068	né devo contentarmi che le sieno conosciute per ingiuste da quelli solamente che conoscono me e loro, ma da ogn’altra persona ancora.		
A1069	Persistendo dunque nel primo loro instituto di voler con ogni immaginabil maniera atterrar me e le cose mie, sapendo come io ne’ miei studii di astronomia e di filosofia tengo, circa alla costituzione delle parti del mondo, che il Sole, senza mutar luogo, resti situato nel centro delle conversioni de gli orbi celesti, e che la Terra, convertibile in se stessa, se gli muova intorno; e di più sentendo che tal posizione vo confermando non solo col reprovar le ragioni di Tolommeo e d’Aristotile, ma col produrne molte in contrario, ed in particolare alcune attenenti ad effetti naturali, le cause de’ quali forse in altro modo non si possono assegnare, ed altre astronomiche, dependenti da molti rincontri de’ nuovi scoprimenti celesti, li quali apertamente confutano il sistema Tolemaico e mirabilmente con quest’altra posizione si accordano e la confermano; e forse confusi per la conosciuta verità d’altre proposizioni da me affermate, diverse dalle comuni; e però diffidando ormai di difesa, mentre restassero nel campo filosofico; si son risoluti a tentar di fare scudo alle fallacie de’ lor discorsi col manto di simulata religione e con l’autorità delle Scritture Sacre, applicate da loro, con poca intelligenza, alla confutazione di argioni né intese né sentite.		
A1070	forse confusi per la conosciuta verità d’altre proposizioni da me affermate, diverse dalle comuni; e però diffidando ormai di difesa, mentre restassero nel campo filosofico; si son risoluti a tentar di fare scudo alle fallacie de’ lor discorsi col manto di simulata religione e con l’autorità delle Scritture Sacre, applicate da loro, con poca intelligenza, alla confutazione di argioni né intese né sentite.		
A1071	E prima, hanno per lor medesimi cercato di spargere concetto nell’universale, che tali proposizioni sieno contro alle Sacre Lettere, ed in conseguenza dannande ed eretiche;		
A1072	scorgendo quanto per lo più l’inclinazione dell’umana natura sia più pronta ad abbracciar quell’imprese dalle quali il prossimo ne venga, ben che, ingiustamente, oppresso,		
A1073	pronta ad abbracciar quell’imprese dalle quali il prossimo ne venga, ben che, ingiustamente, oppresso,		
A1074	il prossimo ne venga, ben che, ingiustamente, oppresso,		
A1075	non gli è stato difficile il trovare chi per tale, cio è per dannada ed eretica, l’abbia con insolita confidenza predicata sin da i pulpiti, con poco pietoso e men considerato aggravio non solo di questa dottrina e di chi la segue, ma di tutte le matematiche e de’ matematici insieme;		
A1076	vanamente sperando che quel seme, che prima fondò radice nella mente loro non sincera, possa diffonder suoi rami ed alzargli verso il cielo, vanno mormorando tra ’l popolo che per tale ella sarà in breve dichiarata dall’autorità suprema.		
A1077	E conoscendo che tal dichiarazione spianterebbe non sol queste due conclusioni, ma renderebbe dannande tutte l’altre osservazioni e proposizioni astronomiche e naturali, che con esse hanno corrispondenza e necessaria connessione, per agevolarsi il negozio cercano, per quanto possono, di far apparir questa opinione, almanco appresso all’universale, come nuova e mia particolare,		
A1078	Niccolò Copernico fu suo autore e più presto innovatore e confermatore, uomo non solamente cattolico, ma sacerdote e canonico,		
A1079	questa riforma, la quale allora rimase imperfetta solo perché non si aveva ancora esatta cognizione della giusta misura dell’anno e del mese lunare:		
A1080	a lui fu dato carico dal Vescovo Semproniense, allora soprintendente a ques’impresa, di cercar con replicati studi e fatiche di venire in maggior lume e certezza di essi movimenti celesti; ond’egli, con fatiche veramente atlantiche e col suo mirabil ingegno, rimessosi a tale studio, si avanzò tanto in queste scienze, e a tale esattezza ridusse la notizia de’ periodi de’ movimenti celesti, che si guadagnò il titolo di sommo astronomo, e conforme alla sua dottrina non solamente si è poi regolato il calendario, ma si fabbricorno le tavole di tutti i movimenti de’ pianeti		
A1081	è stato ricevuto da Santa Chiesa, letto e studiato per tutto il mondo, senza che mai si sia presa pur minima ombra di scrupolo nella sua dottrina.		
A1082	La quale ora mentre si va scoprendo quanto ella sia ben fondata sopra ben manifeste esperienze e necessarie dimostrazioni,		
A1083	necessarie dimostrazioni,		
A1084	manifeste esperienze		
A1085	non mancano persone che, non avendo pur mai veduto tal libro, procurano il premio delle tante fatiche al suo autore con la nota di farlo dichiarare eretico;		
A1086	solamente per sodisfare ad un lor particolare sdegno, concepito senza ragione contro di un altro, che non ha più interesse col Copernico che l’approvar la sua dottrina.		
A1087	per queste false note che costoro tanto ingiustamente cercano di addossarmi, ho stimato necessario per mia giustificazione appresso l’universale, del cui giudizio e concetto, in materia di religione e di reputazione, devo far grandissima stima, discorrer circa a quei particolari che costoro vanno producendo per detestare ed abolire questa opinione, ed in somma per dichiararla non pur falsa, ma eretica, facendosi sempre scudo di un simulato zelo di religione e volendo pur interessare le Scritture Sacre e farle in certo modo ministre de’ loro non sinceri proponimenti, col voler, di più, s’io non erro, contro l’intenzion di quelle e de’ Santi Padri, estendere, per non dir abusare, la loro autorità, sì che anco in conclusioni pure naturali e non de Fide, si deve lasciar totalmente il senso e le ragioni dimostrative per qualche luogo della Scrittura, che tal volta sotto le apparenti parole potrà contenere sentimento diverso.		
A1088	per queste false note che costoro tanto ingiustamente cercano di addossarmi,		
A1089	per dichiararla non pur falsa, ma eretica,		
A1090	volendo pur interessare le Scritture Sacre e farle in certo modo ministre de’ loro non sinceri proponimenti, col voler, di più, s’io non erro, contro l’intenzion di quelle e de’ Santi Padri, estendere, per non dir abusare, la loro autorità, sì che anco in conclusioni pure naturali e non de Fide, si deve lasciar totalmente il senso e le ragioni dimostrative per qualche luogo della Scrittura		
A1091	con quanto più pio e religioso zelo procedo io		
A1092	propongo non che non si danni questo libro, ma che non si danni, come vorrebbono essi, senza intenderlo, ascoltarlo, né pur vederlo,		
A1093	né con ragioni dependenti in modo alcuno da autorità di Scritture Sacre		
A1094	ma sempre se ne sta su conclusioni naturali, attenenti a i moti celesti, trattate con astronomiche e geometriche dimostrazioni, fondate prima sopra sensate esperienze ed accuratissime osservazioni.		
A1095	fondate prima sopra sensate esperienze ed accuratissime osservazioni.		
A1096	astronomiche e geometriche dimostrazioni,		
A1097	Non che egli non avesse posto cura a i luoghi delle Sacre Lettere; ma perché benissimo intendeva, che sendo tal sua dottrina dimostrata, non poteva contrariare alle Scritture intese perfettamente:		
A1098	non poteva contrariare alle Scritture intese perfettamente:		
A1099	Si fortasse erunt matæologi, qui, cum omnium mathematum ignari sint, tamen de illis iudicium assumunt, propter aliquem locum Scripturæ, male ad suum propositum detortum, ausi fuerint hoc meum institutum repræhendere ac insectari, illos nihil moror, adeo ut etiam illorum iudicium tanquam temerarium contemnam. Non enim obscurum est, Lactantium, celebrem alioqui scriptorem, sed mathematicum parum, admodum pueriliter de forma Terræ loqui, cum deridet eos qui Terram globi formam habere prodiderunt. Itaque non debet mirum videri studiosis, si qui tales nos etiam ridebunt. Mathemata mathematicis scribuntur, quibus et hi nostri labores (si me non fallit opinio) videbuntur etiam Republicæ Ecclesiasticæ conducere aliquid, cuius principatum Tua Sanctitas nunc tenet.»		
A1100	E di questo genere si scorge esser questi che s’ingegnano di persuadere che tale autore si danni, senza pur vederlo; e per persuadere che ciò non solamente sia lecito, ma ben fatto, vanno producendo alcune autorità della Scrittura e de’ sacri teologi e de’ Concilii;		
A1101	le quali sì come da me son reverite e tenute di suprema autorità, sì che somma temerità stimerei esser quella di chi volesse contradirgli mentre vengono conforme all’instituto di Santa Chiesa adoperate		
A1102	credo che non sia errore il parlar		
A1103	mentre si può dubitare che alcuno voglia, per qualche suo interesse, produrle e servirsene diversamente da quello che è nella santissima intenzione di Santa Chiesa		
A1104	però protestandomi (e anco credo che la sincerità mia si farà per se stessa manifesta)		
A1105	io intendo non solamente di sottopormi a rimuover liberamente quegli errori ne’ quali per mia ignoranza potessi in questa scrittura incorrere in materie attenenti a religione		
A1106	mi dichiaro ancora non voler nell’istesse materie ingaggiar lite con nissuno		
A1107	mi dichiaro ancora non voler nell’istesse materie ingaggiar lite con nissuno, ancor che fossero punti		
A1108	il mio fine non tende ad altro, se non che, se in queste considerazioni, remote dalla mia professione propria, tra gli errori che ci potessero essere dentro, ci è qualcosa atta ad eccitar altri a qualche avvertimento utile per Santa Chiesa, circa ’l determinar sopra ’l sistema Copernicano, ella sia presa e fattone quel capitale che parrà a’ superiori; se no, sia pure stracciata ed abbruciata la mia scrittura, ch’io non intendo o pretendo di guadagnarne frutto alcuno che non fusse pio e cattolico		
A1109	sia pure stracciata ed abbruciata la mia scrittura, ch’io non intendo o pretendo di guadagnarne frutto alcuno che non fusse pio e cattolico		
A1110	ben che molte delle cose che io noto le abbia sentite con i proprii orecchi, liberamente ammetto e concedo a chi l’ha dette che dette non l’abbia, se così gli piace, confessando poter essere ch’io abbia frainteso; e però quando rispondo non sia detto per loro, ma per chi avesse quella opinione		
A1111	Il motivo, dunque, che loro producono per condennar l’opinione della mobilità della Terra e stabilità del Sole, è, che leggendosi nelle Sacre lettere, in molti luoghi, che il Sole si muove e che la Terra sta ferma, né potendo la Scrittura mai mentire o errare, ne séguita per necessaria conseguenza che erronea e dannanda sia la sentenza di chi volesse asserire, il Sole esser per se stesso immobile, e mobile la Terra		
A1112	Sopra questa ragione parmi primieramente da considerare, essere e santissimamente detto e prudentissimamente stabilito, non poter mai la Sacra Scrittura mentire		
A1113	Sopra questa ragione parmi primieramente da considerare, essere e santissimamente detto e prudentissimamente stabilito, non poter mai la Sacra Scrittura mentire, tutta volta che si sia penetrato il suo vero sentimento; il qual non credo che si possa negare essere molte volte recondito e molto diverso da quello che suona il puro significato delle parole		
A1114	qualunque volta alcuno, nell’esporla, volesse fermarsi sempre nel nudo suono literale, potrebbe, errando esso, far apparir nelle Scritture non solo contradizioni e proposizioni remote dal vero, ma gravi eresie e bestemmie ancora		
A1115	la medesima Sacra Scrittura, qualunque volta gli è occorso di pronunziare alcuna conclusione naturale, e massime delle più recondite e difficili ad esser capite, ella non abbia pretermesso questo medesimo avviso, per non aggiugnere confusione nelle menti di quel medesimo popolo e renderlo più contumace contro a i dogmi di più alto misterio		
A1116	chi vorrà asseverantemente sostenere che l’istessa Scrittura, posto da banda cotal rispetto, nel parlare anco incidentemente di Terra, d’acqua, di Sole o d’altra creatura, abbia eletto di contenersi con tutto rigore dentro a i puri e ristretti significati delle parole? E massime nel pronunziar di esse creature cose non punto concernenti al primario instituto delle medesime Sacre Lettere, ciò è al culto divino ed alla salute dell’anime, e cose grandemente remote dalla apprensione del vulgo		
A1117	le quali proposizioni, sì come, dettante lo Spirito Santo, furono in tal guisa profferite da gli scrittori sacri per accomodarsi alla capacità del vulgo assai rozzo e indisciplinato, così per quelli che meritano d’esser separati dalla plebe è necessario che i saggi espositori ne produchino i veri sensi, e n’additino le ragioni particolari per che e’ siano sotto cotali parole profferiti: ed è questa dottrina così trita e specificata appresso tutti i teologi, che superfluo sarebbe il produrne attestazione alcuna.		
A1118	Stante, dunque, ciò, mi par che nelle dispute di problemi naturali non si dovrebbe cominciare dalle autorità di luoghi delle Scritture, ma dalle sensate esperienze e dalle dimostrazioni necessarie:		
A1119	sensate esperienze		
A1120	dimostrazioni necessarie		
A1121	perché, procedendo di pari dal Verbo divino la Scrittura Sacra e la natura, quella come dettatura dello Spirito Santo, e questa come osservantissima essecutrice de gli ordini di Dio; ed essendo, di più, convenuto nelle Scritture, per accomodarsi all’intendimento dell’universale, dir molte cose diverse, in aspetto e quanto al nudo significato delle parole, dal vero assoluto; ma, all’incontro, essendo la natura inesorabile ed immutabile, e mai non trascendente i termini delle leggi impostegli, come quella che nulla cura che le sue recondite ragioni e modi d’operare sieno o non sieno esposti alla capacità degli uomini; pare che quello degli effetti naturali che o la sensata esperienza ci pone dinanzi a gli occhi o le necessarie dimostrazioni ci concludono, non debba in conto alcuno esser revocato in dubbio, non che condennato, per luoghi della Scrittura che avessero nelle parole diverso sembiante; poi che non ogni detto della Scrittura è legato a obblighi così severi com’ogni effetto di natura, né meno eccelentemente ci si scuopre Iddio negli effetti di natura che ne’ sacri detti delle Scritture: il che volse per avventura intender Tertulliano in quelle parole: «Nos definimus, Deum primo natura cognoscendum, deinde doctrina recognoscendum: natura, ex operibus; doctrina, ex prædicationibus.»		
A1122	convenuto nelle Scritture, per accomodarsi all’intendimento dell’universale, dir molte cose diverse, in aspetto e quanto al nudo significato delle parole, dal vero assoluto		
A1123	pare che quello degli effetti naturali che o la sensata esperienza ci pone dinanzi a gli occhi o le necessarie dimostrazioni ci concludono, non debba in conto alcuno esser revocato in dubbio, non che condennato, per luoghi della Scrittura		
A1124	Ma non per questo voglio inferire, non doversi aver somma considerazione de i luoghi delle Scritture Sacre		
A1125	venuti in certezza di alcune conclusioni naturali, doviamo servircene per mezi accomodatissimi alla vera esposizione di esse Scritture ed all’investigazione di quei sensi che in loro necessariamente si contengono, come verissime e concordi con le verità dimostrate		
A1126	Stimerei per questo che l’autorità delle Sacre Lettere avesse avuto la mira a persuadere principalmente a gli uomini quegli articoli e proposizioni, che, superando ogni umano discorso, non potevano per altra scienza né per altro mezzo farcisi credibili, che per la bocca dell’istesso Spirito Santo		
A1127	in quelle proposizioni che non sono de Fide l’autorità delle medesime Sacre Lettere deva esser anteposta all’autorità di tutte le Scritture umane, scritte non con metodo dimostrativo, ma o con pura narrazione o anco con probabili ragioni, direi doversi reputar tanto convenevole e necessario, quanto l’istessa divina sapienza supera ogni umano giudizio e coniettura		
A1128	che quell’istesso Dio che ci ha dotati di sensi, di discorso e d’intelletto, abbia voluto, posponendo l’uso di questi, darci con altro mezo le notizie che per quelli possiamo conseguire, sì che anco in quelle conclusioni naturali, che o dalle sensate esperienze o dalle necessarie dimostrazioni ci vengono esposte innanzi a gli occhi e all’intelletto, doviamo negare il senso e la ragione, non credo che sia necessario il crederlo		
A1129	massime in quelle scienze delle quali una minima particella solamente, ed anco in conclusioni divise, se ne legge nella Scrittura; quale appunto è l’astronomia, di cui ve n’è così piccola parte, che non vi si trovano né pur nominati i pianeti, eccetto il Sole e la Luna, e duna o due volte solamente, Venere, sotto nome di Lucifero		
A1130	che non solamente gli autori delle Sacre Letter non abbino preteso d’insegnarci le costituzioni e movimenti de’ cieli e delle stelle, e loro figure, grandezze e distanze, ma che a bello studio, ben che tutte queste cose fussero a loro notissime, se ne sieno astenuti, è opinione di santissimi e dottissimi Padri: ed in sant’Agostino si leggono le seguenti parole: «Quæri etiam solet, quæ forma et figura cæli esse credenda sit secundum Scripturas nostras: multi enim multum disputant de iis rebus, quas maiore prudentia nostri authores omiserunt, ad beatam vitam non profuturas discentibus, et occupantes (quod peius est) multum prolixa et rebus salubribus impedenda temporum spatia. Quid enim ad me pertinet, ultram cælum, sicut sphera, undique concludat Terram, in media mundi mole libratam, an eam ex una parte desuper, velut discus, operiat? Sed quia de fide agitur Scripturarum, propter illam causam quam non semel commemoravi, ne scilicet quisquam, eloquia divina non intelligens, cum de his rebus tale aliquid vel invenerit in libris nostris vel ex illis audierit quod perceptis assertionibus adversari videatur, nullo modo eis cætera utilia monentibus vel narrantibus vel pronunciantibus credat; breviter dicendum est, de figura cæli hoc scisse authores nostros quod veritas habet, sed Spiritum Dei, qui per ipsos loquebatur, noluisse ista docere homines, nulli saluti profutura.»		
A1131	E pur l’istesso disprezzo avuto da’ medesimi scrittori sacri nel determinar quello che si deva credere di tali accidenti de’ corpi celesti ci vien nel seguente cap. 10 replicato dal medesimo Sant’Agostino, nella quistione, se si deva stimare che ’l cielo si muova o pure stia fermo, scrivendo così: «De motu etiam cæli nonnulli fratres quæstionem movent, utrum stets an moveatur: quia si movetur, inquiunt, quomodo firmamentum est? Si autem stat, quomodo sydera, quæ in ipso fixa creduntur, ab oriente usque ad occidentem circumeunt, septentrionalibus breviores gyros iuxta cardinem peragentibus, ut cælum, si est alius nobis occultus cardo ex alio vertice, sicut sphera, si autem nullus alius cardo est, veluti discus, rotari videatur? Quibus respondeo, multum subtilibus et laboriosis ista perquiri, ut vere percipiatrur utrum ita an non ita sit; quibus ineundis atque tractandis nec mihi iam tempus est, nec illis esse debet quos ad salutem suam et Sanctæ Ecclesiæ necessariam utilitatem cupimus informari.»		
A1132	Dalle quali cose descendendo più al nostro particolare, ne séguita per necessaria conseguenza, che non avendo voluto lo Spirito Santo insegnarci se il cielo si muova o stia fermo, né la sua figura sia in forma di sfera o di disco o distesa in piano, né se la Terra sia contenuta nel centro di esso o da una banda, non avrà manco avuto intenzione di renderci certi di altre conclusioni dell’istesso genere, e collegate in maniera con le pur ora nominate, che senza la determinazion di esse non se ne può asserire questa o quella parte; quali sono il determinar del moto e della quiete di essa Terra e del Sole.		
A1133	E se l’istesso Spirito Santo a bello studio ha pretermesso d’insegnarci simili proposizioni, come nulla attenenti alla sua intenzione, ciò è alla nostra salute, come si potrà adesso affermare, che il tener di esse questa parte, e non quella, sia tanto necessario che l’una sia de Fide, e l’altra erronea? Potrà, dunque essere un’opinione eretica, e nulla concernente alla salute dell’anime? o potrà dirsi, aver lo Spirito Santo voluto non insegnarci cosa concernente alla salute? Io qui direi che quello che intesi da persona ecclesiastica costituita in eminentissimo grado, ciò è l’intenzione delle Spirito Santo essere d’insegnarci come si vadia al cielo, e non come vadia il cielo.		
A1134	potrà dirsi, aver lo Spirito Santo voluto non insegnarci cosa concernente alla salute? Io qui direi che quello che intesi da persona ecclesiastica costituita in eminentissimo grado, ciò è l’intenzione delle Spirito Santo essere d’insegnarci come si vadia al cielo, e non come vadia il cielo.		
A1135	Ma torniamo a considerare, quanto nelle conclusioni naturali si devono stimar le dimostrazioni necessarie e le sensate esperienze,		
A1136	si devono stimar le dimostrazioni necessarie		
A1137	sensate esperienze,		
A1138	e di quanta autorità le abbino reputate i dotti e i santi teologici; da i quali, tra cent’altre attestazioni, abbiamo le seguenti: «Illud etiam diligenter cavendum et omnino fugiendum est, ne in tractanda Mosis doctrina quidquam affirmate et asseveranter sentiamus et dicamus, quod repugnet manifestis experimentis et rationibus philosopiæ vel aliarum disciplinarum: namque, cum verum omne semper cum vero congruat, non potest veritas Sacrarum Literarum veris rationibus et experimentis humanarum doctrinarum esse contraria.» Ed appresso sant’Agostino si legge: «Si manifestæ certæque rationi velut Santarum Scripturarum obiicitur authoritas, non intelligit qui hoc facit; et non Scripturæ sensum, ad quem penetrare non potuit, sed suum potius, obiicit veritati; nec quod in ea, sed in ipso, velut pro ea, invenit, opponit.»		
A1139	è officio de’ saggi espositori affaticarsi per penetrare i veri sensi de’ luoghi sacri, che indubitabilmente saranno concordanti con quelle conclusioni naturali, delle quali il senso manifesto e le dimostrazioni necessarie ci avessero prima resi certi e sicuri.		
A1140	le Scritture per l’addotte cagioni ammettono in molti luoghi esposizioni lontane dal significato delle parole		
A1141	fusse molto prudentemente fatto se non si permettesse ad alcuno impegnare i luoghi della Scrittura ed in certo modo obligargli a dover sostener per vere queste o quelle conclusioni naturali, delle quali una volta il senso e le ragioni dimostrative e necessarie ci potessero manifestare il contrario.		
A1142	chi vuol por termine alli umani ingegni? Chi vorrà asserire, già essersi veduto e saputo tutto quello che è al mondo di sensibile e di scibile?		
A1143	non si dovrà, per mio parere, contradicendo a tal sentenza, precluder la strada al libero filosofare circa le cose del mondo e della natura		
A1144	Né si dovrebbe stimar temerità il non si quietare nelle opinioni già state quasi comuni, né dovrebb’esser chi prendesse a sdegno se alcuno non aderisce in dispute naturali a quell’opinione che piace loro, e massime intorno a problemi stati già migliaia d’anni controversi		
A1145	opinione tenuta da Pittagora, e da tutta la sua setta, e da Eraclide Pontico, il quale fu dell’istessa opinione, da Filolao maestro di Platone, e dall’istesso Platone, come riferisce Aristotile, e del quale scrive Plutarco nella vita di Numa, che esso Platone già fatto vecchio diceva, assurdissima cosa essere il tenere altramente. L’istesso fu creduto da Aristarco Samio, come abbiamo appresso Archimede, da Seleuco matematico, da Niceta filosofo, referente Cicerone, e da molti altri, e finalmente ampliata e con molte osservazioni e dimostrazioni confermata da Niccolò Copernico. E Seneca, eminentissimo filosofo, nel libro De cometis ci avvertisce, doversi con grandissima diligenza cercar di venire in certezza, se sia il cielo o la Terra in cui risegga la diurna conversione.		
A1146	E per questo, oltre agli articoli concernenti alla salute ed allo stabilimento della Fede, contro la fermezza de’ quali non è pericolo alcuno che possa insurgere mai dottrina valida ed efficace		
A1147	disordine veramente sarebbe l’aggiugnergli a richiesta di persone, le quali, oltre che noi ignoriamo se parlino inspirate da celeste virtù, chiaramente vediamo che in esse si potrebbe desiderare quella intelligenza che sarebbe necessaria prima a capire, e poi a redarguire, le dimostrazioni con le quali le acutissime scienze procedono nel confermare simili conclusioni.		
A1148	in esse si potrebbe desiderare quella intelligenza che sarebbe necessaria prima a capire, e poi a redarguire, le dimostrazioni con le quali le acutissime scienze procedono nel confermare simili conclusioni.		
A1149	forse più converrebbe al decoro ed alla maestà di esse Sacre Lettere il provvedere che non ogni leggiero e vulgare scrittore potesse, per autorizzar sue composizioni, bene spesso fondate sopra vane fantasie, spargervi luoghi della Scrittura Santa, interpetrati, o più presto stiracchiati, in sensi tanto remoti dall’intenzione retta di essa Scrittura, quanto vicini alla derisione di coloro che non senza qualche ostentazione se ne vanno adornando		
A1150	L’uno de’ quali sieno le scritture che furon pubblicate contro a i pianeti Medicei, ultimamente da me scoperti, contro la cui esistenza furono opposti molti luoghi della Sacra Scrittura: ora che i pianeti si fanno veder da tutto il mondo, sentirei volentieri con quali nuove interpretazioni vien da quei medesimi oppositori esposta la Scrittura, e scusata la lor semplicità.		
A1151	che la Luna non altramente riceve lume dal Sole, ma è per se stessa splendida; la qual immaginazione conferma in ultimo, o, per meglio dire, si persuade di confermare, con varii luoghi della Scrittura, li quali gli par che non si potessero salvare, quando la sua opinione non fusse vera e necessaria. Tutta via, che la Luna sia per se stessa tenebrosa, è non men chiaro che lo splendor del Sole.		
A1152	Quindi resta manifesto che tali autori, per non aver penetrato i veri sensi della Scrittura,		
A1153	l’avrebbono, quando la loro autorità fosse di gran momento, posta in obligo di dover costringere altrui a tener per vere, conclusioni repugnanti alle ragioni manifeste ed al senso		
A1154	abuso che Deus avertat che andasse pigliando piede o autorità, perché bisognerebbe vietar in breve tempo tutte le scienze speculative		
A1155	quelli, scorrendo superficialmente le Scritture, si arrogherebbono autorità di poter decretare sopra tutte le questioni della natura, in vigore di qualche parola mal intesa da loro ed in altro proposito prodotta dagli scrittori sacri: né potrebbe il piccol numero degl’intendenti reprimer il furioso torrente di quelli, i quali troverebbono tanti più seguaci, quanto il potersi far reputar sapienti senza studio e senza fatica è più soave che il consumarsi senza riposo intorno alle discipline laboriosissime.		
A1156	scorrendo superficialmente le Scritture, si arrogherebbono autorità di poter decretare sopra tutte le questioni della natura,		
A1157	in vigore di qualche parola mal intesa da loro ed in altro proposito prodotta dagli scrittori sacri		
A1158	il potersi far reputar sapienti senza studio e senza fatica è più soave che il consumarsi senza riposo intorno alle discipline laboriosissime.		
A1159	Però grazie infinite doviamo render a Dio benedetto, il quale per sua benignità ci spoglia di questo timore, mentre spoglia d’autorità simil sorte di persone, riponendo il consultare, risolvere e decretare sopra determinazioni tanto importanti nella somma sapienza e bontà di prudentissimi padri e nella suprema autorità di quelli, che, scorti dallo Spirito Sabnto non possono se non santamente ordinare, permettendo che della leggerezza di quelli altri non sia fatto stima. Questa sorte d’uomini, per mio credere, son quelli contro i quali, non senza ragione, si riscaldano i gravi e santi scrittori, e de i quali in particolare scrive San Girolamo: «Hanc» (intendendo della Scrittura Sacra) «garrula anus, hanc delirus senex, hanc sophista verbosus, hanc universi præsumunt, lacerant, docent antequam discant. Alii, adducto supercilio, grandia verba trutinantes, inter mulierculas de Sacris Literis philosophantur; alii discunt, proh pudor, a fæminis quod viros doceant, et, ne parum hoc sit, quadam facilitate verborum, imo audacia, edisserunt aliis quod ipsi non intelligunt. Taceo de mei similibus, qui, si forte ad Scriputras Sanctas post seculares literas venerint, et sermone composito aurem populi mulserint, quidquid dixerint, hoc legem Dei putant, nec scire dignantur quid Prophetæ quid Apostoli senserint, sed ad sensum suum incongrua aptant testimonia; quasi grande sit, et non vitiosissimum docendi genus, depravare sententias, et ad voluntatem suam Scripturam trahere repugnantem.»		
A1160	Io non voglio metter nel numero di simili scrittori secolari alcuni teologi, riputati da me per uomini di profonda dottrina e di santissimi costumi, e per ciò tenuti in grande stima e venerazione		
A1161	sento che essi pretendono di poter costringere altri, con l’autorità della Scrittura, a seguire in dispute naturali quella opinione che pare a loro che più consuoni con i luoghi di quella, stimandosi insieme di non essere in obbligo di solvere le ragioni o esperienze in contrario.		
A1162	stimandosi insieme di non essere in obbligo di solvere le ragioni o esperienze in contrario.		
A1163	In esplicazione e confirmazione del qual lor parere, dicono che essendo la teologia regina di tutte le scienze, non deve in conto alcuno abbassarsi per accomodarsi a’ dogmi dell’altre men degne ed a lei inferiori, ma sì ben l’altre devono riferirsi ad essa, come a suprema imperatrice, e mutare ed alterar le lor conclusioni conforme alli statuti e decreti teologicali		
A1164	e più aggiungono che quando nell’inferiore scienza si avesse alcuna conlusione per sicura, in vigor di dimostrazioni o di esperienze, alla quale si trovassi nella Scrittura altra conclusione repugnante, devono gli stessi professori di quella scienza procurar per se medesimi di quella scienza procurare per se medesimi di scioglier le lor dimostrazioni e scoprir le fallacie delle proprie esperienze, senza ricorrere a i teologi e scritturali		
A1165	quando nell’inferiore scienza si avesse alcuna conlusione per sicura, in vigor di dimostrazioni o di esperienze,		
A1166	non convenendo, come si è detto, alla dignità della teologia abbassarsi all’investigazione delle fallacie delle scienze soggette, ma solo bastando a lei il determinargli la verità della conclusione, con l’assoluta autorità e con la sicurezza di non poter errare.		
A1167	E prima, dubiterei che potesse cader qualche poco di equivocazione, mentre che non si distinguessero le preminenze per le quali la sacra teologia è degna del titolo di regina.		
A1168	Imperò che ella potrebbe esser tale, o vero perché quello che da tutte l’altre scienze viene insegnato, si trovasse compreso e dimostrato in lei, ma con mezi più eccellenti e con più sublime dottrina, nel modo che, per essempio, le regole del misurare i campi e del conteggiare molto più eminentemente si contengono nell’aritmetica e geometria d’Euclide, che nelle pratiche degli agrimensori e de’ computisti		
A1169	Che alla teologia convenga il titolo e la autorità regia nella prima maniera, non credo che poss’essere affermato per vero da quei teologi che avranno qualche pratica nell’altre scienze; de’ quali nissuno crederò io che dirà che molto più eccellente ed esattamente si contenga la geometria, la astronomia, la musica e la medicina ne’ libri sacri, che in Archimede, in Tolommeo, in Boezio ed in Galeno. Però pare che la regia sopreminenza se gli deva nella seconda maniera, ciò è per l’altezza del suggetto, e per l’ammirabil insegnamento delle divine revelazioni in quelle conclusioni che per altri mezi non potevano dagli uomini esser comprese e che sommamente concernono all’acquisto dell’eterna beatitudine. Ora, se la teologia, occupandosi nell’altissime contemplazioni divine e risedendo per dignità nel trono regio, per lo che ella è fatta di somma autorità, non discende alle più basse ed umili speculazioni delle inferiori scienze, anzi, come di sopra si è dichiarato, quelle non cura, come non concernenti alla beatitudine, non dovrebbono i ministri e i professori di quella arrogarsi autorità di decretare nelle professioni non essercitate né studiate da loro; perché questo sarebbe come se un principe assoluto, conoscendo di poter liberamente comandare e farsi ubbidire, volesse, non essendo egli né medico né architetto, che si medicasse e fabbricasse a modo suo, con grave pericolo della vita de’ miseri infermi, e manifesta rovina degli edifizi.		
A1170	Il comandar poi a gli stessi professori d’astronomia, che procurino per lor medesimi di cautelarsi contro alle proprie osservazioni e dimostrazioni, come quelle che non possino esser altro che fallacie e sofismi, è un comandargli cosa più che impossibile a farsi; perché non solamente se gli comanda che non vegghino quel che e’ veggono e che non intendino quel che gl’intendono, ma che, cercando, trovino il contrario di quello che gli vien per le mani.		
A1171	Io vorrei pregar questi prudentissimi Padri, che volessero con ogni diligenza considerare la differenza che è tra le dottrine opinabili e le dimostrative; acciò, rappresentandosi bene avanti la mente con qual forza stringhino le necessarie illazioni, si accertassero maggiormente come non è in potestà de’ professori delle scienze demostrative il mutar l’opinioni a voglia loro		
A1172	non con, l’istessa facilità si possono mutare le conclusioni dimostrate circa le cose della natura e del cielo, che le opinioni circa a quello che sia lecito o no in un contratto, in un censo, in un cambio		
A1173	nei libri de’ sapienti di questo mondo si contenghino alcune cose della natura dimostrate veracemente, ed altre semplicemente insegnate; e che, quanto alle prime, sia ofizio de’ saggi teologi mostrare che le non son contrarie alle Sacre Scritture; quanto all’altre, insegnate ma non necessariamente dimostrate, se vi sarà cosa contraria alle Sacre Lettere, si deve stimare che sia indubitatamente falsa, e tale in ogni possibil modo si deve dimostrare.		
A1174	prima che condannare una proposizion naturale, mostrar ch’ella non sia dimostrata necessariamente: e questo devon fare non quelli che la tengon per vera, ma quelli che la stiman falsa		
A1175	prima che condannare una proposizion naturale, mostrar ch’ella non sia dimostrata necessariamente		
A1176	in questo particolare accadrà che i seguaci di questa opinione, quanto più andran rivolgendo le carte, esaminando le ragioni, replicando l’osservazione e riscontrando l’esperienze, tanto più si confermino in questa credenza		
A1177	E l’Altezza Vostra sa quel che occorse al matematico passato dello Studio di Pisa, che messosi nella sua vecchiezza a vedere la dottrina del Copernico con speranza di poter fondatamente confutarla (poi che in tanto la reputava falsa, in quanto non l’aveva mai veduta), gli avvenne, che non prima restò capace de’ suoi fondamenti, progressi e dimostrazioni, che ei si trovò persuaso, e d’impugnatore ne divenne saldissimo mantenitore. Potrei anco nominargli altri matematici, i quali, mossi da gli ultimi miei scoprimenti, hanno confessato esser necessario mutare la già concepita costituzione del mondo, non potendo in conto alcuno più sussistere.		
A1178	Se per rimuover dal mondo questa opinione e dottrina batasse il serrar la bocca ad un solo, come forse si persuadono quelli che, misurando i giudizi degli altri co ’l loro proprio, gli par impossibile che tal opinione abbia a sussistere e trovar seguaci, questo sarebbe facilissimo a farsi; ma il negozio cammina altramente; perché, per eseguire una tal determinazione, sarebbe necessario proibir non solo il libro del Copernico e gli scritti degli altri autori che seguono l’istessa dottrina, ma bisognerebbe interdire tutta la scienza d’astronomia intiera, e più, vietar a gli uomini guardare verso il cielo		
A1179	bisognerebbe interdire tutta la scienza d’astronomia intiera		
A1180	e più, vietar a gli uomini guardare verso il cielo		
A1181	per eseguire una tal determinazione, sarebbe necessario proibir non solo il libro del Copernico e gli scritti degli altri autori che seguono l’istessa dottrina, ma bisognerebbe interdire tutta la scienza d’astronomia intiera, e più, vietar a gli uomini guardare verso il cielo		
A1182	Ma il proibire il Copernico, ora che per molte nuove osservazioni e per l’applicazione di molti literati alla sua lettura si va di giorno in giorno scoprendo più vera la sua posizione e ferma la sua dottrina, avendol’ammesso per tanti anni mentre egli era men seguito e confermato, parrebbe, a mio giudizio, un contravvenire alla verità, e cercar tanto più di occultarla e supprimerla, quanto più ella si dimostra palese e chiara		
A1183	Il non abolire interamente tutto il libro, ma solamente dannar per erronea questa particolar proposizione, sarebbe, s’io non m’inganno, detrimento maggior per l’anime, lasciandogli occasione di veder provata una proposizione, la qual fusse poi peccato il crederla		
A1184	Il proibir tutta la scienza, che altro sarebbe che un reprovar cento luoghi delle Sacre Lettere, i quali ci insegnano come la gloria e la grandezza del sommo Iddio mirabilmente si scorge in tutte le sue fatture, e divinamente si legge nell’aperto libro del cielo?		
A1185	Né sia chi creda che la lettura degli altissimi concetti, che sono scritti in quelle carte, finisca nel solo veder lo splendor del Sole e delle stelle e ’l lor nascere ed ascondersi, che è il termine sin dove penetrano gli occhi dei bruti e del vulgo; ma vi son dentro misteri tantro profondi e concetti tanto sublimi, che le vigilie, le fatiche e gli studi di cento e cento acutissimi ingegni non gli hanno ancora interamente penetrati con l’investigazioni continuate per migliaia e migliaia d’anni. E credino pure gli idioti che, sì come quello che gli occhi loro comprendono nel riguardar l’aspetto esterno d’un corpo umano è piccolissima cosa in comparazione de gli ammirandi artifizi che in esso ritrova un esquisito e diligentissimo anatomista e filosofo, mentre va investigando l’uso di tanti muscoli, tendini, nervi ed ossi, esaminando gli offizi del cuore e de gli altri membri principali, ricercando le sedi delle facultà vitali, osservando le maravigliose strutture de gli strumenti de’ sensi, e, senza finir mai di stupirsi e di appagarsi, contemplando i ricetti dell’immaginazione, della memoria e del discorso; così quello che ’l puro senso della vista rappresenta, è come nulla in proporzion de’ l’alte meraviglie che, mercé delle lunghe ed accurate osservazioni, l’ingegno degl’intelligenti scorge nel cielo. E questo è quanto mi occorre considerare circa a questo particolare.		
A1186	Quanto poi a quello che soggiungono, che quelle proposizioni naturali delle quali la Scrittura pronunzia sempre l’istesso e che i Padri tutti concordemente nell’istesso senso ricevono, debbino esser intese conforme al nudo significato delle parole, senza glose e interpretazioni, e ricevute e tenute per verissime, e che in conseguenza, per esser tale la mobilità del Sole e la stabilità della Terra, sia de Fide il tenerle per vere, ed erronea l’opinion contraria; mi occorre di considerar, prima, che delle proposizioni naturali alcune sono delle quali, con ogni umana specolazione e discorso, solo se ne può conseguire più presto qualche probabile opinione e verisimil coniettura, che una sicura e dimostrata scienza, come, per esempio, se le stelle sieno animate; altre sono, delle quali o si ha, o si può credere fermamente che aver si possa, con esperienze, con lunghe osservazioni e con necessarie dimostrazioni, indubitata certezza, quale è, se la Terra e ’l Sole si muovino o no, se la Terra sia sferica o no. Quanto alle prime, io non dubito punto che dove gli umani discorsi non possono arrivare, e che di esse per conseguenza non si può avere scienza, ma solamente opinione e fede, piamente convenga conformarsi assolutamente col puro senso della Scrittura. Ma quanto alle altre, io crederei, come di sopra si è detto, che prima fosse d’accertarsi del fatto, il quale ci scorgerebbe al ritrovamento de’ veri sensi delle Scritture, li quali assolutamente si troverebbero concordi col fatto dimostrato, ben che le parole nel primo aspetto sonassero altramente; poi che due veri non possono mai contrariarsi.		
A1187	delle proposizioni naturali alcune sono delle quali, con ogni umana specolazione e discorso, solo se ne può conseguire più presto qualche probabile opinione e verisimil coniettura, che una sicura e dimostrata scienza		
A1188	altre sono, delle quali o si ha, o si può credere fermamente che aver si possa, con esperienze, con lunghe osservazioni e con necessarie dimostrazioni, indubitata certezza,		
A1189	Quanto alle prime, io non dubito punto che dove gli umani discorsi non possono arrivare, e che di esse per conseguenza non si può avere scienza, ma solamente opinione e fede, piamente convenga conformarsi assolutamente col puro senso della Scrittura.		
A1190	Ma quanto alle altre, io crederei, come di sopra si è detto, che prima fosse d’accertarsi del fatto, il quale ci scorgerebbe al ritrovamento de’ veri sensi delle Scritture, li quali assolutamente si troverebbero concordi col fatto dimostrato, ben che le parole nel primo aspetto sonassero altramente; poi che due veri non possono mai contrariarsi.		
A1191	E questa mi par dottrina tanto retta e sicura, quanto io la trovo scritta puntualmente in sant’Agostino, il quale, parlando a punto della figura del cielo e quale essa si deve credere essere, poi che pare che quel che ne affermano gli astronomi sia contrario alla Scrittura, stimandola quegli rotonda, e chiamandola la scrittura distesa come una pelle, determina che niente si ha da curar che la Scrittura contrarii a gli astronomi, ma credere alla sua autorità, se quello che loro dicono sarà falso e fondato solamente sopra conietture dell’infirmità umana; ma se quello che loro affermano fosse provato con ragioni indubitabili, non dice questo Santo Padre che si comandi a gli astronomi che lor medesimi, solvendo le lor dimostrazioni, dichiarino la lor conclusione per falsa, ma dice che si deve mostrare che quello che è detto nella Scrittura della pelle, non è contario a quelle vere dimostrazioni.		
A1192	niente si ha da curar che la Scrittura contrarii a gli astronomi, ma credere alla sua autorità,		
A1193	ma se quello che loro affermano fosse provato con ragioni indubitabili, non dice questo Santo Padre che si comandi a gli astronomi che lor medesimi, solvendo le lor dimostrazioni, dichiarino la lor conclusione per falsa, ma dice che si deve mostrare che quello che è detto nella Scrittura della pelle, non è contario a quelle vere dimostrazioni.		
A1194	non dice questo Santo Padre che si comandi a gli astronomi che lor medesimi, solvendo le lor dimostrazioni, dichiarino la lor conclusione per falsa,		
A1195	Segue poi di ammonirci che noi non doviamo esser meno osservanti in concordare un luogo della Scrittura con una proposizione naturale dimostrata, che con un altro luogo della Scrittura che sonasse il contrario. Anzi mi par degna d’esser ammirata ed immitata la circuspezzione di questo Santo, il quale anco nelle conclusioni oscure, e delle quali si può esser sicuri che non se ne possa avere scienza per dimostrazioni umane, va molto riservato nel determinar quello che si deva credere,		
A1196	la intenzione de’ Santi Padri esser, che nelle quistioni naturali e che non son de Fide prima si deva considerar se elle sono indubitabilmente dimostrate o con esperienze sensate conosciute,		
A1197	la quale ottenendosi, ed essendo ella ancora dono di Dio, si deve applicare all’investigazione de’ veri sensi delle Sacre Lettere in quei luoghi che in apparenza mostrassero di sonar diversamente; i quali indubitatamente saranno penetrati da’ sapienti teologi,		
A1198	Quanto all’altro punto, riguardando noi al primario scopo di esse Sacre Lettere, non crederei che l’aver loro sempre parlato nell’istesso senso avesse a perturbar questa regola; perché, se occorrendo alla Scrittura, per accomodarsi alla capacità del vulgo, pronunziare una volta una proposizione con parole di sentimento diverso dalla essenza di essa proposizione; perché non dovrà ella aver osservato l’istesso, per l’istesso rispetto, quante volte gli occorreva la medesima cosa? Anzi mi pare che ’l fare altramente averebbe cresciuta la confusione, e scemata la credulità nel popolo.		
A1199	né si può pur tentar di rimuoverlo, non sendo capace delle ragioni contrarie, dependenti da troppo esquisite osservazioni e sottili dimostrazioni, appoggiate sopra astrazioni, che ad esser concepite richieggon troppo gagliarda imaginativa.		
A1200	poi che de i mille uomini vulgari che venghino interrogati sopra questi particolari, forse non se ne troverà uno solo, che non risponda, parergli, e così creder per fermo, che ’l Sole si muova e che la Terra stia ferma. Ma non però deve alcun prendere questo comunissimo assenso popolare per argumento della verità di quel che viene asserito; perché se noi interrogheremo gli stessi uomini delle cause e motivi per i quali e’ credono in quella maniera, ed, all’incontro, ascolteremo quali esperienze e dimostrazioni induchino quegli altri pochi a creder il contrario, troveremo questi esser persuasi da saldissime ragioni, e quelli da semplicissime apparenze e rincontri vani e ridicoli.		
A1201	Che dunque fosse necessario attribuire al Sole il moto, e la quiete alla Terra, per non confonder la poca capacità del vulgo e renderlo renitente e contumace nel prestar fede a gli articoli principali e che sono assolutamente de Fide, è assai manifesto: e se così era necessario a farsi, non è punto da meravigliarsi che così sia stato con somma prudenza esseguito nelle divine Scritture.		
A1202	Perché, se noi tenteremo la capacità degli uomini vulgari, gli troveremo molto più inetti a restar persuasi della stabilità del Sole e mobilità della Terra, che dell’esser lo spazio, che ci circonda, ripieno d’aria: adunque, se gli autori sacri in questo punto, che non aveva tanta difficoltà appresso la capacità del vulgo ad esser persuaso, nulla dimeno si sono astenuti dal tentare di persuaderglielo, non dovrà parere se non molto ragionevole che in altre proposizioni molto più recondite abbino osservato il medesimo stile.		
A1203	Ora da questo luogo mi pare che assai chiaramente argumentar si possa, che la Scrittura Sacra, per il medesimo rispetto, abbia avuto più gran cagione di chiamare il Sole mobile e la Terra stabile. Perché, se noi tenteremo la capacità degli uomini vulgari, gli troveremo molto più inetti a restar persuasi della stabilità del Sole e mobilità della Terra, che dell’esser lo spazio, che ci circonda, ripieno d’aria: adunque, se gli autori sacri in questo punto, che non aveva tanta difficoltà appresso la capacità del vulgo ad esser persuaso, nulla dimeno si sono astenuti dal tentare di persuaderglielo, non dovrà parere se non molto ragionevole che in altre proposizioni molto più recondite abbino osservato il medesimo stile.		
A1204	Che poi la comun concordia de’ Padri, nel ricever una proposizione naturale dalla Scrittura nel medesimo senso tutti, debba autenticarla in maniera che divenga de Fide il tenerla per tale, crederei che ciò si dovesse al più intender di quelle conclusioni solamente, le quali fussero da essi Padri state discusse e ventilate con assoluta diligenza e disputate per l’una e per l’altra parte, accordandosi poi tutti a reprovar quella e tener questa. Ma la mobilità della Terra e stabilità del Sole non son di questo genere,		
A1205	Non basta dunque il dir che i Padri tutti ammettono la stabilità della Terra, etc., adunque il tenerla è de Fide; ma bisogna provar che gli abbino condennato l’opinione contraria;		
A1206	se ci fecero applicazione e considerazione, già l’averebbono dannata se l’avessero giudicata per erronea; il che non si trova che essi abbino fatto.		
A1207	Oltre che io averei qualche dubbio circa la verità di tal determinazione, ciò è se sia vero che la Chiesa obblighi a tenere come de Fide simili conclusioni naturali, insignite solamente di una concorde interpretazione di tutti i Padri: e dubito che poss’essere che quelli che stimano in questa maniera, possin aver desiderato d’ampliar a favor della propria opinione il decreto de’ Concilii,		
A1208	ciò è se sia vero che la Chiesa obblighi a tenere come de Fide simili conclusioni naturali,		
A1209	la mobilità o stabilità della Terra o del Sole non son de Fide né contro a i costumi, né vi è chi voglia scontorcere luoghi della Scrittura per contrariare a Santa Chiesa o a i Padri:		
A1210	E quanto i decreti de’ Concilii si conformino co’ santi Padri in questi particolari, può esser assai manifesto: poi che tantum abest che si risolvino a ricever per de Fide simili conclusioni naturali o a reprovar come erronee le contrarie opinioni che, più presto avendo riguardo alla primaria intenzione di Santa Chiesa, reputano inutile l’occuparsi in cercar di venir in certezza di quelle. Senta l’Altezza Vostra Serenissima quello che risponde sant’Agostino a quei fratelli che muovono la quistione, se sia vero che il cielo si muova o pure stia fermo: «His respondeo, multum subtilis et laboriosis rationibus ista perquiri, ut vere percipiatur utrum ita an non ita sit: quibus ineundis atque tractandis nech mihi iam tempus est, nec illis esse debet quos ad salutem suam et Sanctæ Ecclesiæ necessarium utilitatem cupimus informari.»		
A1211	potrà esser fatta da i sapienti della nostra età, li quali, ascoltate prima l’esperienze, l’osservazioni, le ragioni e le dimostrazioni de’ filosofi ed astronomi per l’una e per l’altra parte, poi che la controversia è di problemi naturali e di dilemmi necessarii ed impossibili ad essere altramente che in una delle due maniere controverse, potranno con assai sicurezza determinar quello che le divine ispirazioni gli detteranno.		
A1212	li quali, ascoltate prima l’esperienze, l’osservazioni, le ragioni e le dimostrazioni de’ filosofi ed astronomi per l’una e per l’altra parte, poi che la controversia è di problemi naturali e di dilemmi necessarii ed impossibili ad essere altramente che in una delle due maniere controverse,		
A1213	La quale dignità chi non vede con quanto maggior zelo vien desiderata e procurata da quelli che, sottoponendosi onninamente a Santa Chiesa, domandano non che si proibisca questa o quella opinione, ma solamente di poter mettere in considerazione cose onde ella maggiormente si assicuri nell’elezione più sicura, che da quelli che, abbagliati da proprio interesse o sollevati da maligne suggestioni, predicano che ella fulmini senz’altro la spada, poi che ella ha potestà di farlo, non considerando che non tutto quel che si può fare è sempre utile che si faccia?		
A1214	da quelli che, abbagliati da proprio interesse o sollevati da maligne suggestioni, predicano che ella fulmini senz’altro la spada, poi che ella ha potestà di farlo,		
A1215	domandano non che si proibisca questa o quella opinione, ma solamente di poter mettere in considerazione cose onde ella maggiormente si assicuri nell’elezione più sicura,		
A1216	conoscendo di quanto progiudizio e quanto contro al primario instituto della Chiesa Cattolica sarebbe il volere da’ luoghi della Scrittura definire conclusioni naturali, delle quali, o con esperienze o con dimostrazioni necessarie, si potrebbe in qualche tempo dimostrare il contrario di quel che suonan le nude parole, sono andati non solamente circospettissimi, ma hanno, per ammaestramento degli altri, lasciati i seguenti precetti: «In rebus obscuris atque a nostri oculis remotissimis, si qua inde scripta, etiam divina, legerimus, quæ possint, salva fide qua imbuimur, aliis atque aliis parere sententiis, in ullam earum nos præcipiti affirmatione ita proiiciamus, ut, si forte diligentius discussa veritas eam recte labefactaverit, corruamus; non pro sententia divinarum Scripturarum, sed pro nostra ita dimicantes, ut eam velimus Scripturarum esse, quæ nostra est, com potius eam, quæ Scripturarum est, nostram esse velle debeamus.»		
A1217	devesi con l’aiuto del vero dimostrato cercar il senso sicuro della Scrittura, e non, conforme al nudo suono delle parole, che sembrasse vero alla debolezza nostra, volere in certo modo sforzar la natura e negare l’esperienze e le dimostrazioni necessarie.		
A1218	Ma noti di più, l’Altezza Vostra, con quante circospezzioni cammina questo santissimo uomo prima che risolversi ad affermare alcuna interpretazione della Scrittura per certa e talmente sicura che non si abbia da temere di poter incontrare qualche difficoltà che ci apporti disturbo, che, non contento che alcun senso della Scrittura concordi con alcuna dimostrazione, soggiugne: «Si autem hoc verum esse certa ratio demonstraverit, adhuc incertum erit, utrum hoc in illis verbis sanctorum librorum scriptor sentiri voluerit, an aliquid aliud non minus verum: quod si cætera contextio sermonis non hoc eum voluisse probaverit, non ideo falsum erit aliud quod ipse intelligi voluit, sed et verum et quod utlis cognoscatur.»		
A1219	Quanto poi restino offesi i Padri veramente saggi e prudenti da questi tali che, per sostener proposizioni da loro non capite, vanno in certo modo impegnando i luoghi delle Scritture, riducendosi poi ad accrescere il primo errore col produrr’altri luoghi meno intesi de’ primi, esplica il medesimo Santo con le parole che seguono: «Quid enim molestiæ tristiæque ingerant prudentibus fratribus temerarii præsumptores, satis dici non potest, cum si quando de prava et falsa opinione sua repræhendi et convinci cœperint ab eis qui nostrorum librorum authoritate non tenentur, ad defendendum id quod levissima temeritate et apertissima falsitate dixerunt, eosdem libros sanctos unde id probent, proferre conantur; vel etiam memoriter, quæ ad testimonium valere arbitrantur, multa inde verba pronunciant, non intelligentes neque quæ loquuntur neque de quibus affirmant.»		
A1220	Del numero di questi parmi che sieno costoro, che non volendo o non potendo intendere le dimostrazioni ed esperienze con le quali l’autore ed i seguaci di questa posizione la confermano, attendono pure a portare innanzi le Scritture, non si accorgendo che quante più ne producono e quanto più persiston in affermar quelle esser chiarissime e non ammetter altri sensi che quelli che essi gli danno, di tanto maggior progiudizio sarebbono alla dignità di quelle (quando il lor giudizio fosse di molta autorità), se poi la verità conosciuta manifestamente in contrario arrecasse qualche confusione, al meno in quelli che son separati da Santa Chiesa, de’ quali pur ella è zelantissima e madre desiderosa di ridurgli nel suo grembo. Vegga dunque l’Altezza Vostra quanto disordinatamente procedono quelli che, nelle dispute naturali, nella prima fronte costituiscono per loro argomenti luoghi della Scrittura, e ben spesso malamente da loro intesi.		
A1221	che quello che sostiene il vero, può aver molte esperienze sensate e molte dimostrazioni necessarie per la parte sua,		
A1222	l’avversario non può valersi d’altro che d’ingannevoli apparenze, di paralogismi e di fallacie.		
A1223	se questi tali veramente stimano e interamente credono d’avere il vero sentimento di un tal luogo particolare della Scrittura, bisogna, per necessaria conseguenza, che si tenghino anco sicuri d’aver in mano l’assoluta verità di quella conclusione naturale che intendono di disputare, e che insieme conoschino d’aver grandissimo vantaggio sopra l’avversario, a cui tocca a difender la parte falsa; essendo che quello che sostiene il vero, può aver molte esperienze sensate e molte dimostrazioni necessarie per la parte sua, mentre che l’avversario non può valersi d’altro che d’ingannevoli apparenze, di paralogismi e di fallacie.		
A1224	Ma, se io devo dir il vero, credo che essi sieno i primi atterriti, e che, sentendosi inabili a potere star forti contro alli assalti dell’avversario, tentino di trovar modo di non se lo lasciar accostare, vietandogli l’uso del discorso che la Divina Bontà gli ha conceduto, ed abusando dell’autorità giustissima della Sacra Scrittura che, ben intesa e usata, non può mai, conforme alla comun sentenza de’ teologi, oppugnar le manifeste esperienze o le necessarie dimostrazioni.		
A1225	Però, quando volessero procedere con sincerità, doverebbono o, tacendo, confessarsi inabili a poter trattar di simili materie,		
A1226	considerare che non è nella potestà loro né di altri che del Sommo Pontefice o de’ sacri Concilii il dichiarare una proposizione per erronea, ma che bene sta nell’arbitrio loro il disputar della sua falsità; dipoi, intendendo come è impossibile che alcuna proposizione sia insieme vera ed eretica, dovrebbono occuparsi di quella parte che più aspetta a loro, ciò è in dimostrar la falsità di quella; la quale come avessero scoperta, o non occorrerebbe più il proibirla, perché nessuno la seguirebbe, o il proibirla sarebbe sicuro e senza pericolo di scandalo alcuno.		
A1227	Però applichinsi prima questi tali a redarguire le ragioni del Copernico e di altri,		
A1228	lascino il condennarla poi per erronea ed eretica a chi ciò si appartiene;		
A1229	Quel che non può errare, quelle repentine resoluzioni nelle quali essi talora si lascerebbono precipitare da qualche loro affetto o interesse particolare; perché sopra queste ed altre simili proposizioni, che non sono direttamente de Fide, non è chi dubiti che il Sommo Pontefice ritien sempre assoluta potestà di ammetterle o di condennarle; ma non è già in poter di creatura alcuna il farle esser vere o false, diversamente da quel che elleno per sua natura e de facto si trovano essere.		
A1230	Però par che miglior consiglio sia l’assicurarsi prima della necessaria ed immutabil verità del fatto, sopra la quale nissuno ha imperio,		
A1231	Però par che miglior consiglio sia l’assicurarsi prima della necessaria ed immutabil verità del fatto, sopra la quale nissuno ha imperio, che, senza tal sicurezza, col dannare una parte spogliarsi dell’autorità e libertà di poter sempre eleggere, riducendo sotto necessità quelle determinazioni che di presente sono indifferenti e libere e riposte nell’arbitrio dell’autorità suprema. Ed in somma, se non è possibile che una conclusione sia dichiarata eretica mentre si dubita che ella poss’esser vera, vana doverà esser la fatica di quelli che pretendono di dannar la mobilità della Terra e la stabilità del Sole, se prima non la dimostrano essere impossibile e falsa.		
A1232	senza tal sicurezza, col dannare una parte spogliarsi dell’autorità e libertà di poter sempre eleggere, riducendo sotto necessità quelle determinazioni che di presente sono indifferenti e libere e riposte nell’arbitrio dell’autorità suprema.		
A1233	Resta finalmente che consideriamo, quanto sia vero che il luogo di Giosuè si possa prendere senza alterare il puro significato delle parole, e come possa essere che, obedendo il Sole al comandamento di Giosuè, che fu che egli si fermasse, ne potesse da ciò seguire che il giorno per molto spazio si prolungasse.		
A1234	Quando dunque Iosuè avesse avuto intenzione che le sue parole fossero prese nel loro puro e propriissimo significato, averebbe detto al Sole ch’egli accelerasse il suo movimento, tanto che il ratto del primo mobile non lo portasse all’occaso; ma perchè le sue parole erano ascoltate da gente che forse non aveva altra cognizione de’ movimenti celesti che di questo massimo e comunissimo da levante a ponente, accomodandosi alla capacità loro, e non avendo intenzione d’insegnargli la costituzione delle sfere, ma solo che comprendessero la grandezza del miracolo fatto nell’allungamento del giorno, parlò conforme all’intendimento loro.		
A1235	Parmi dunque, s’io non m’inganno, che assai chiaramente si scorga che, posto il sistema Tolemaico, sia necessario interpretar le parole con qualche sentimento diverso dal loro puro significato: la quale interpretazione, ammonito dagli utilissimi documenti di sant’Agostino, non direi esser necessariamente questa, sì che altra forse migliore e più accomodata non potesse sovvenire ad alcun altro. Ma se forse questo medesimo, più conforme a quanto leggiamo in Giosuè, si potesse intendere nel sistema Copernicano, con l’aggiunta di un’altra osservazione, nuovamente da me dimostrata nel corpo solare, voglio per ultimo mettere in considerazione; parlando sempre con quei medesimi riserbi di non esser talmente affezionato alle cose mie, che io voglia anteporle a quelle degli altri, e creder che di migliori e più conformi all’intenzione delle Sacre Lettere non se ne possino addurre.		
A1236	vengo nel secondo luogo a considerare come il corpo solare, ben che stabile nell’istesso luogo, si rivolge però in se stesso, facendo un’intera conversione in un mese in circa, sì come concludentemente mi par d’aver dimostrato nelle mie Lettere delle Macchie Solari:		
A1237	Ma quello di che, s’io non m’inganno, si deve far non piccola stima, è che con questa costituzione Copernicana si ha il senso literale apertissimo e facilissimo d’un altro particolare che si legge nel medesimo miracolo; il quale è, che il Sole si fermò nel mezo del cielo. Sopra ’l qual passo gravi teologi muovono difficoltà: poi che par molto probabile che quando Giosuè domandò l’allungamento del giorno, il Sole fusse vicino al tramontare, e non al meridiano; perché quando fusse stato nel meridiano, essendo allora intorno al solstizio estivo, e però i giorni lunghissimi, non par verisimile che fusse necessario pregar l’allungamento del giorno per conseguir vittoria in un conflitto, potendo benissimo bastare per ciò lo spazio di sette ore e più di giorno che rimanevano ancora.		
A1238	Quanto poi ad altri luoghi della Scrittura, che paiono contrariare a questa posizione, io non ho dubbio che quando ella fusse conosciuta per vera e dimostrata, quei medesimi teologi che, mentre la reputan falsa, stimano tali luoghi incapaci di esposizioni concordanti con quella, ne troverebbono interpretazioni molto ben congruenti, e massime quando all’intelligenza delle Sacre Lettere aggiugnessero qualche cognizione delle scienze astronomiche: e come di presente, mentre la stimano falsa, gli par d’incontrar, nel leggere le Scritture, solamente luoghi ad essa repugnanti, quando si avessero formato altro concetto, ne incontrerebbero per avventura altrettanti di concordi;		
A1239	Quanto poi ad altri luoghi della Scrittura, che paiono contrariare a questa posizione, io non ho dubbio che quando ella fusse conosciuta per vera e dimostrata, quei medesimi teologi che, mentre la reputan falsa, stimano tali luoghi incapaci di esposizioni concordanti con quella, ne troverebbono interpretazioni molto ben congruenti,

A1241	Io scopersi pochi anni a dietro, come ben sa l’Altezza Vostra Serenissima, molti particolari nel cielo, stati invisibili sino a questa età; li quali, sì per la novità, sì per alcune conseguenze che da essi dependono, contrarianti ad alcune proposizioni naturali comunemente ricevute dalle scuole de i filosofi, mi eccitorno contro non piccol numero di tali professori; quasi che io di mia mano avessi tali cose collocate in cielo, per intorbidar la natura e le scienze.		
A1242	contrarianti ad alcune proposizioni naturali comunemente ricevute dalle scuole de i filosofi,		
A1243	la moltitudine de’ veri concorre all’investigazione, accrescimento e stabilimento delle discipline,		
A1244	dimostrandosi nell’istesso tempo più affezionati alle proprie opinioni che alle vere, scorsero a negare e far prova d’annullare quelle novità, delle quali il senso istesso, quando avessero voluto con attenzione riguardarle, gli averebbe potuti render sicuri		
A1245	produssero varie cose, ed alcune scritture pubblicarono ripiene di vani discorsi, e, quel che fu più grave errore, sparse di attestazioni delle Sacre Scritture, tolte da luoghi non bene da loro intesi e lontano dal proposito addotti

A1247	Nunc autem, servata semper moderatione piæ gravitatis, nihil credere de re obscura temere debemus, ne forte quod postea veritas patefecerit, quamvis libris sanctis, sive Testamenti Veteris sive Novi, nullo modo esse possit adversum, tamen propter amorem nostri errori oderimus.

A1282	non mancano persone che, non avendo pur mai veduto tal libro, procurano il premio delle tante fatiche al suo autore con la nota di farlo dichiarare eretico; e questo solamente per sodisfare ad un lor particolare sdegno, concepito senza ragione contro di un altro, che non ha più interesse col Copernico che l’approvar la sua dottrina.		
A1283	per queste false note che costoro tanto ingiustamente cercano di addossarmi, ho stimato necessario per mia giustificazione appresso l’universale, del cui giudizio e concetto, in materia di religione e di reputazione, devo far grandissima stima, discorrer circa a quei particolari che costoro vanno producendo per detestare ed abolire questa opinione		
A1284	mia giustificazione appresso l’universale

A1286	contro l’intenzion di quelle e de’ Santi Padri, estendere, per non dir abusare, la loro autorità, sì che anco in conclusioni pure naturali e non de Fide, si deve lasciar totalmente il senso e le ragioni dimostrative per qualche luogo della Scrittura, che tal volta sotto le apparenti parole potrà contenere sentimento diverso.

A1289	con quanto più pio e religioso zelo procedo io, che non fanno loro

A1297	mi dichiaro ancora non voler nell’istesse materie ingaggiar lite con nissuno, ancor che fossero punti disputabili		
A1298	perché il mio fine non tende ad altro, se non che, se in queste considerazioni, remote dalla mia professione propria, tra gli errori che ci potessero essere dentro, ci è qualcosa atta ad eccitar altri a qualche avvertimento utile per Santa Chiesa, circa ’l determinar sopra ’l sistema Copernicano, ella sia presa e fattone quel capitale che parrà a’ superiori; se no, sia pure stracciata ed abbruciata la mia scrittura, ch’io non intendo o pretendo di guadagnarne frutto alcuno che non fusse pio e cattolico

A1304	Il motivo, dunque, che loro producono per condennar l’opinione della mobilità della Terra e stabilità del Sole, è, che leggendosi nelle Sacre lettere, in molti luoghi, che il Sole si muove e che la Terra sta ferma, né potendo la Scrittura mai mentire o errare, ne séguita per necessaria conseguenza che erronea e dannanda sia la sentenza di chi volesse asserire, il Sole esser per se stesso immobile, e mobile la Terra.

A1327	venuti in certezza di alcune conclusioni naturali, doviamo servircene per mezi accomodatissimi alla vera esposizione di esse Scritture ed all’investigazione di quei sensi che in loro necessariamente si contengono, come verissime e concordi con le verità dimostrate.

A1337	Però se gli scrittori sacri avessero avuto pensiero di persuadere al popolo le disposizioni e movimenti de’ corpi celesti, e che in conseguenza dovessimo noi ancora dalle Sacre Scritture apprender tal notizia, non ne avrebbon, per mio credere, trattato così poco, che è come niente in comparazione delle infinite conclusioni ammirande che in tale scienza si contengono e si dimostrano.

A1350	crederei che fusse molto prudentemente fatto se non si permettesse ad alcuno impegnare i luoghi della Scrittura ed in certo modo obligargli a dover sostener per vere queste o quelle conclusioni naturali, delle quali una volta il senso e le ragioni dimostrative e necessarie ci potessero manifestare il contrario

A1356	libero filosofare		
A1357	Né si dovrebbe stimar temerità il non si quietare nelle opinioni già state quasi comuni		
A1358	né dovrebb’esser chi prendesse a sdegno se alcuno non aderisce in dispute naturali a quell’opinione che piace loro		
A1359	con molte osservazioni e dimostrazioni confermata		
A1360	E per questo, oltre agli articoli concernenti alla salute ed allo stabilimento della Fede, contro la fermezza de’ quali non è pericolo alcuno che possa insurgere mai dottrina valida ed efficace, non saria forse se non saggio ed util consiglio il non ne aggregar altri senza necessità: e se così è, disordine veramente sarebbe l’aggiugnergli a richiesta di persone, le quali, oltre che noi ignoriamo se parlino inspirate da celeste virtù, chiaramente vediamo che in esse si potrebbe desiderare quella intelligenza che sarebbe necessaria prima a capire, e poi a redarguire, le dimostrazioni con le quali le acutissime scienze procedono nel confermare simili conclusioni.

A1370	ma non posso già negare di non rimaner con qualche scrupolo, ed in conseguenza con desiderio che mi fusse rimosso, mentre sento che essi pretendono di poter costringere altri, con l’autorità della Scrittura, a seguire in dispute naturali quella opinione che pare a loro che più consuoni con i luoghi di quella, stimandosi insieme di non essere in obbligo di solvere le ragioni o esperienze in contrario

A1372	non posso già negare di non rimaner con qualche scrupolo		
A1373	mentre sento che essi pretendono di poter costringere altri, con l’autorità della Scrittura, a seguire in dispute naturali quella opinione che pare a loro che più consuoni con i luoghi di quella, stimandosi insieme di non essere in obbligo di solvere le ragioni o esperienze in contrario		
A1374	quando nell’inferiore scienza si avesse alcuna conlusione per sicura, in vigor di dimostrazioni o di esperienze, alla quale si trovassi nella Scrittura altra conclusione repugnante, devono gli stessi professori di quella scienza procurar per se medesimi di quella scienza procurare per se medesimi di scioglier le lor dimostrazioni e scoprir le fallacie delle proprie esperienze, senza ricorrere a i teologi e scritturali; non convenendo, come si è detto, alla dignità della teologia abbassarsi all’investigazione delle fallacie delle scienze soggette, ma solo bastando a lei il determinargli la verità della conclusione, con l’assoluta autorità e con la sicurezza di non poter errare.		
A1375	Ora intorno a queste determinazioni mi accascano da considerare alcuni particolari, li quali proporrò per esserne reso cauto da chi più di me intende di queste materie, al giudizio de’ quali io sempre mi sottopongo		
A1376	E prima, dubiterei che potesse cader qualche poco di equivocazione, mentre che non si distinguessero le preminenze per le quali la sacra teologia è degna del titolo di regina. Imperò che ella potrebbe esser tale, o vero perché quello che da tutte l’altre scienze viene insegnato, si trovasse compreso e dimostrato in lei, ma con mezi più eccellenti e con più sublime dottrina, nel modo che, per essempio, le regole del misurare i campi e del conteggiare molto più eminentemente si contengono nell’aritmetica e geometria d’Euclide, che nelle pratiche degli agrimensori e de’ computisti; o vero perché il suggetto, intorno al quale si occupa la teologia, superasse di dignità tutti gli altri suggetti che son materia dell’altre scienze, ed anco perché i suoi insegnamenti procedessero con mezi più sublimi		
A1377	nissuno crederò io che dirà che molto più eccellente ed esattamente si contenga la geometria, la astronomia, la musica e la medicina ne’ libri sacri, che in Archimede, in Tolommeo, in Boezio ed in Galeno.		
A1378	non dovrebbono i ministri e i professori di quella arrogarsi autorità di decretare nelle professioni non essercitate né studiate da loro;		
A1379	Io vorrei pregar questi prudentissimi Padri, che volessero con ogni diligenza considerare la differenza che è tra le dottrine opinabili e le dimostrative; acciò, rappresentandosi bene avanti la mente con qual forza stringhino le necessarie illazioni, si accertassero maggiormente come non è in potestà de’ professori delle scienze demostrative il mutar l’opinioni a voglia loro, applicandosi ora a questa ed ora a quella, e che gran differenza è tra il comandare a un matematico o a un filosofo e ’l disporre un mercante o un legista		
A1380	nei libri de’ sapienti di questo mondo si contenghino alcune cose della natura dimostrate veracemente, ed altre semplicemente insegnate		
A1381	dimostrate veracemente		
A1382	Se, dunque, le conclusioni naturali, dimostrate veracemente, non si hanno a posporre a i luoghi della Scrittura, ma sì ben dichiarare come tali luoghi non contrariano ad esse conclusioni, adunque bisogna, prima che condannare una proposizion naturale, mostrar ch’ella non sia dimostrata necessariamente: e questo devon fare non quelli che la tengon per vera, ma quelli che la stiman falsa;		
A1383	e ciò par molto ragionevole e conforme alla natura; ciò è che molto più facilmente sien per trovar le fallacie in un discorso quelli che lo stiman falso, che quelli che lo reputan vero e concludente; anzi in questo particolare accadrà che i seguaci di questa opinione, quanto più andran rivolgendo le carte, esaminando le ragioni, replicando l’osservazione e riscontrando l’esperienze, tanto più si confermino in questa credenza.		
A1384	Se per rimuover dal mondo questa opinione e dottrina batasse il serrar la bocca ad un solo, come forse si persuadono quelli che, misurando i giudizi degli altri co ’l loro proprio, gli par impossibile che tal opinione abbia a sussistere e trovar seguaci, questo sarebbe facilissimo a farsi;		
A1385	bisognerebbe interdire tutta la scienza d’astronomia intiera, e più, vietar a gli uomini guardare verso il cielo, acciò non vedessero Marte e Venere or vicinissimi alla terra or remotissimi con tanta differenza che questa si scorge 40 volte, e quello fa 60, maggior una volta che l’altra, ed acciò che la medesima Venere non si scorgesse or rotonda or falcata con sottilissime corna, e molte altre sensate osservazioni, che in modo alcuno non si possono adattare al sistema Tolemaico, ma son saldissimi argumenti del Copernicano		
A1386	si va di giorno in giorno scoprendo più vera la sua posizione e ferma la sua dottrina		
A1387	più vera la sua posizione		
A1388	Il non abolire interamente tutto il libro, ma solamente dannar per erronea questa particolar proposizione, sarebbe, s’io non m’inganno, detrimento maggior per l’anime, lasciandogli occasione di veder provata una proposizione, la qual fusse poi peccato il crederla.		
A1389	misteri tantro profondi e concetti tanto sublimi, che le vigilie, le fatiche e gli studi di cento e cento acutissimi ingegni non gli hanno ancora interamente penetrati con l’investigazioni continuate per migliaia e migliaia d’ann

A1391	con esperienze, con lunghe osservazioni e con necessarie dimostrazioni		
A1392	Quanto alle prime, io non dubito punto che dove gli umani discorsi non possono arrivare, e che di esse per conseguenza non si può avere scienza, ma solamente opinione e fede, piamente convenga conformarsi assolutamente col puro senso della Scrittura. Ma quanto alle altre, io crederei, come di sopra si è detto, che prima fosse d’accertarsi del fatto, il quale ci scorgerebbe al ritrovamento de’ veri sensi delle Scritture, li quali assolutamente si troverebbero concordi col fatto dimostrato, ben che le parole nel primo aspetto sonassero altramente		
A1393	niente si ha da curar che la Scrittura contrarii a gli astronomi, ma credere alla sua autorità, se quello che loro dicono sarà falso e fondato solamente sopra conietture dell’infirmità umana; ma se quello che loro affermano fosse provato con ragioni indubitabili, non dice questo Santo Padre che si comandi a gli astronomi che lor medesimi, solvendo le lor dimostrazioni, dichiarino la lor conclusione per falsa, ma dice che si deve mostrare che quello che è detto nella Scrittura della pelle, non è contario a quelle vere dimostrazioni.		
A1394	hoc enim verum est, quod divina dicit authoritas, potius quam illud quod humana infirmitas coniicit. Sed si forte illud talibus illi documentis probare potuerint, ut dubitari inde non debeat, demonstrandum est, hoc quod apud nos est de pelle dictum, veris illis rationibus non esse contrarium		
A1395	mi par degna d’esser ammirata ed immitata la circuspezzione di questo Santo, il quale anco nelle conclusioni oscure, e delle quali si può esser sicuri che non se ne possa avere scienza per dimostrazioni umane, va molto riservato nel determinar quello che si deva credere		
A1396	Di qui e da altri luoghi parmi, s’io non m’inganno, la intenzione de’ Santi Padri esser, che nelle quistioni naturali e che non son de Fide prima si deva considerar se elle sono indubitabilmente dimostrate o con esperienze sensate conosciute, o vero se una tal cognizione e dimostrazione aver si possa: la quale ottenendosi, ed essendo ella ancora dono di Dio, si deve applicare all’investigazione de’ veri sensi delle Sacre Lettere in quei luoghi che in apparenza mostrassero di sonar diversamente; i quali indubitatamente saranno penetrati da’ sapienti teologi, insieme con le ragioni per che lo Spirito Santo gli abbia volsuti tal volta, per nostro essercizio o per altra a me recondita ragione, velare sotto parole di significato diverso.		
A1397	troppo esquisite osservazioni e sottili dimostrazioni		
A1398	Per lo che, quando bene appresso i sapienti fusse più che certa e dimostrata la stabilità del Sole e ’l moto della Terra, bisognerebbe ad ogni modo, per mantenersi il credito appresso il numerosissimo volgo, proferire il contrario		
A1399	Per lo che, quando bene appresso i sapienti fusse più che certa e dimostrata la stabilità del Sole e ’l moto della Terra, bisognerebbe ad ogni modo, per mantenersi il credito appresso il numerosissimo volgo, proferire il contrario; poi che de i mille uomini vulgari che venghino interrogati sopra questi particolari, forse non se ne troverà uno solo, che non risponda, parergli, e così creder per fermo, che ’l Sole si muova e che la Terra stia ferma		
A1400	saldissime ragioni		
A1401	questi esser persuasi da saldissime ragioni, e quelli da semplicissime apparenze e rincontri vani e ridicol		
A1402	Anzi, conoscendo l’istesso Copernico qual forza abbia nella nostra fantasia un’invecchiata consuetudine ed un modo di concepir le cose già sin dall’infanzia fattoci familiare, per non accrescer confusione e difficoltà nella nostra astrazione, dopo aver prima dimostrato che i movimenti li quali a noi appariscono esser del sole o del firmamento son veramente della Terra, nel venir poi a ridurgli in tavole ed all’applicargli all’uso, gli va nominando per del Sole e del cielo superiore a i pianeti, chiamando nascere e tramontar del sole, delle stelle, mutazioni nell’obliquità dello zodiaco e variazione ne’ punti degli equinozii, movimento medio, anomalia e prostaferesi del Sole, ed altre cose tali, quelle che son veramente della Terra.		
A1403	quanto sia ben fatto l’accomodarsi al nostro più consueto modo d’intendere		
A1404	accomodarsi alla credenza del vulgo		
A1405	si accomodorno all’uso ricevuto		
A1406	esperienze e dimostrazioni		
A1407	Che poi la comun concordia de’ Padri, nel ricever una proposizione naturale dalla Scrittura nel medesimo senso tutti, debba autenticarla in maniera che divenga de Fide il tenerla per tale, crederei che ciò si dovesse al più intender di quelle conclusioni solamente, le quali fussero da essi Padri state discusse e ventilate con assoluta diligenza e disputate per l’una e per l’altra parte, accordandosi poi tutti a reprovar quella e tener questa		
A1408	Ma quando pure anco nelle proposizioni naturali, da luoghi della Scrittura esposti concordemente nel medesimo senso da tutti i Padri si avesse a prendere la resoluzione di condennarle o ammetterle, non però veggo che questa regola avesse luogo nel nostro caso, avvenga che sopra i medesimi luoghi si leggono de’ Padri diverse esposizioni:		
A1409	vero		
A1410	con quanto maggior zelo vien desiderata e procurata da quelli che, sottoponendosi onninamente a Santa Chiesa, domandano non che si proibisca questa o quella opinione, ma solamente di poter mettere in considerazione cose onde ella maggiormente si assicuri nell’elezione più sicura, che da quelli che, abbagliati da proprio interesse o sollevati da maligne suggestioni, predicano che ella fulmini senz’altro la spada,		
A1411	esperienze o con dimostrazioni necessarie		
A1412	si potrebbe in qualche tempo dimostrare il contrario di quel che suonan le nude parole		
A1413	conoscendo di quanto progiudizio e quanto contro al primario instituto della Chiesa Cattolica sarebbe il volere da’ luoghi della Scrittura definire conclusioni naturali, delle quali, o con esperienze o con dimostrazioni necessarie, si potrebbe in qualche tempo dimostrare il contrario di quel che suonan le nude parole, sono andati non solamente circospettissimi, ma hanno, per ammaestramento degli altri, lasciati i seguenti precetti		
A1414	nissuna proposizione può esser contro la Fede se prima non è dimostrata esser falsa		
A1415	veritate		
A1416	Dal che si vede come falsi sarebbono i sentimenti che noi dessimo a’ luoghi della Scrittura, ogni volta che non concordassero con le verità dimostrate: e però devesi con l’aiuto del vero dimostrato cercar il senso sicuro della Scrittura, e non, conforme al nudo suono delle parole, che sembrasse vero alla debolezza nostra, volere in certo modo sforzar la natura e negare l’esperienze e le dimostrazioni necessarie		
A1417	non contento che alcun senso della Scrittura concordi con alcuna dimostrazione, soggiugne: «Si autem hoc verum esse certa ratio demonstraverit, adhuc incertum erit, utrum hoc in illis verbis sanctorum librorum scriptor sentiri voluerit, an aliquid aliud non minus verum: quod si cætera contextio sermonis non hoc eum voluisse probaverit, non ideo falsum erit aliud quod ipse intelligi voluit, sed et verum et quod utlis cognoscatur.		
A1418	ragioni dimostrative		
A1419	E finalmente, quasi volendo render ragione di questo suo instituto, col mostrarci a quali pericoli esporrebbono sé e le Scritture e la Chiesa quelli che, riguardando più al mantenimento d’un suo errore che alla dignità della Scrittura, vorrebbono estender l’autorità di quella oltre a i termini che ella stessa si prescrive, soggiugne le seguenti parole, che per sé sole doverebbono bastare a reprimere e moderare la soverchia licenza che tal uno pretende di potersi pigliare		
A1420	certissima ratione vel experientia		
A1421	experiri vel indubitatis rationibus		
A1422	dimostrazioni ed esperienze		
A1423	Del numero di questi parmi che sieno costoro, che non volendo o non potendo intendere le dimostrazioni ed esperienze con le quali l’autore ed i seguaci di questa posizione la confermano, attendono pure a portare innanzi le Scritture, non si accorgendo che quante più ne producono e quanto più persiston in affermar quelle esser chiarissime e non ammetter altri sensi che quelli che essi gli danno		
A1424	Vegga dunque l’Altezza Vostra quanto disordinatamente procedono quelli che, nelle dispute naturali, nella prima fronte costituiscono per loro argomenti luoghi della Scrittura, e ben spesso malamente da loro intesi.		
A1425	assoluta verità		
A1426	esperienze sensate e molte dimostrazioni necessarie		
A1427	Ma se questi tali veramente stimano e interamente credono d’avere il vero sentimento di un tal luogo particolare della Scrittura, bisogna, per necessaria conseguenza, che si tenghino anco sicuri d’aver in mano l’assoluta verità di quella conclusione naturale che intendono di disputare, e che insieme conoschino d’aver grandissimo vantaggio sopra l’avversario, a cui tocca a difender la parte falsa; essendo che quello che sostiene il vero, può aver molte esperienze sensate e molte dimostrazioni necessarie per la parte sua, mentre che l’avversario non può valersi d’altro che d’ingannevoli apparenze, di paralogismi e di fallacie.		
A1428	manifeste esperienze o le necessarie dimostrazioni		
A1429	mpossibile che alcuna proposizione sia insieme vera ed eretica		
A1430	ma non è già in poter di creatura alcuna il farle esser vere o false, diversamente da quel che elleno per sua natura e de facto si trovano essere		
A1431	necessaria ed immutabil verità del fatto		
A1432	libertà		
A1433	sopra la quale nissuno ha imperio		
A1434	La qual cosa, stante i movimenti celesti conforme alla costituzione Tolemaica, non può in modo alcuno avvenire:		
A1435	accomodandosi alla capacità loro		
A1436	parlando sempre con quei medesimi riserbi di non esser talmente affezionato alle cose mie, che io voglia anteporle a quelle degli altri, e creder che di migliori e più conformi all’intenzione delle Sacre Lettere non se ne possino addurre		
A1437	sì come concludentemente mi par d’aver dimostrato nelle mie Lettere delle Macchie Solari		
A1438	necessariamente dimostro,		
A1439	conosciuta per vera e dimostrata		
A1440	conosciuta per vera		
A1441	anto poi ad altri luoghi della Scrittura, che paiono contrariare a questa posizione, io non ho dubbio che quando ella fusse conosciuta per vera e dimostrata, quei medesimi teologi che, mentre la reputan falsa, stimano tali luoghi incapaci di esposizioni concordanti con quella, ne troverebbono interpretazioni molto ben congruenti, e massime quando all’intelligenza delle Sacre Lettere aggiugnessero qualche cognizione delle scienze astronomiche:		
A1442	come di presente, mentre la stimano falsa, gli par d’incontrar, nel leggere le Scritture, solamente luoghi ad essa repugnanti, quando si avessero formato altro concetto, ne incontrerebbero per avventura altrettanti di concordi		
A1443	I consulted how to join a Number of them together, so as to carry a heavier Weight, which if I could compass, I might enable a Man to be carried safely in the Air from one Place to another. I puzzled my Wits extremely with this Thought,		
A1444	and upon Trial found		
A1445	I contrived at last a Way whereby each might rise with only his own Proportion of Weight;		
A1446	I added two or three Birds more, and made Trial of their carrying a Lamb		
A1447	I much envied, that he should be the first living Creature to partake of such an excellent Device.		
A1448	At length after divers Trials		
A1449	I should have resented his ambitious Thought		
A1450	my Heart even swell with Joy and Admiration at my own Invention		
A1451	worthy better Fortune than afterwards befel him		
A1452	I adjured him by Oaths and Persuasions to be secret in the Business, though I did not much doubt it, assuring myself he durst not impart the Experiment to any before our King were acquainted therewith

A1463	I thought it necessary to secure myself from these Villains, who out of Hatred to us Spaniards, would have cut me to Pieces		
A1464	O Reader prick up thy Ears, and prepare thyself to hear the strangest Chance that ever happened to any Mortal, and which I know thou wilt not have the Grace to believe till thou seest the like Experiment, which I doubt not in a short Time may be performed

A1472	those Things we call heavy do not fall towards the Center of the Earth as their natural Place, but are drawn by a secret Property of the Globe of the Earth		
A1473	For though my Gansas would continue unmoved, without being sustained by any Thing but the Air, as easily and quietly as a Fish in the Water, yet if they forced themselves never so little, it is impossible to imagine with what Swiftness they were carried, either Upward, Downward, or Sideways		
A1474	the Illusions of Devils and wicked Spirits		
A1475	I was much obliged to those, whether Men or Devils I know not		
A1476	If I would follow their Directions, I should not only be carried safe Home, but be assured to command at all Times all the Pleasures of that Place		
A1477	they readily brought me very good Flesh and Fish of several Sorts, and well dressed, but that it was extreme fresh without any Relish of Salt. Wines likewise I tasted of divers Kinds as good as any in Spain, and Beer no better in all Antwerp

A1481	as for the Philosophers attributing Heat and Moisture to the Air, I always esteemed it a Fancy		
A1482	what else might be the Cause I cannot determine		
A1483	the Earth, which I had ever in mine Eye, seemed to made itself with a kind of Brightness like another Moon, and as we discern certain Spots or Clouds as it were in the Moon, so did I then see the like in the Earth;		
A1484	the Reason whereof seems to be, that whereas the Earth according to his natural Motion (for such a Motion I am now satisfied she hath according to the Opinion of Copernicus) turns round upon her own Axis every four and twenty Hours from West to East		
A1485	I am now satisfied she hath according to the Opinion of Copernicus		
A1486	the Reason whereof seems to be		
A1487	so that it seemed to me no other than an huge mathematical Globe turned round leisurely before me		
A1488	this was all the Means I now had to number the Days, and reckon the Time		
A1489	I could now wish that Philosophers and Mathematicians would confess their own Blindness		
A1490	who have hitherto made the World believe that the Earth hath no Motion, and to confirm it, are forced to attribute to every one of the celestial Bodies two Motions directly contrary to each other, one from the East to the West, to be performed in twenty-four Hours with an impetuous rapid Motion		
A1491	O incredible Supposition		
A1492	But to attribute to these celestial Bodies contrary Motions at once, is an absurd Conceit, and much more to imagine, that the same Orb wherein the fixed Stars are, whose natural Course takes up so many thousands of Years, should be turned about every twenty-four Hours		
A1493	only this I say, allow the Earth its Motion, which these Eyes of mine can testify to be true, and all those Absurdities are removed, every one having only his own single and proper Motion		
A1494	which these Eyes of mine can testify to be true		
A1495	testify to be true		
A1496	I promised an History, and am unawares turned Disputer		
A1497	He that reads the Discourses of learned Men		
A1498	and adds thereto this Experience of mine		
A1499	will easily conclude		
A1500	The first Difference I found between this and our Earth was, that it appeared in its natural Colours		
A1501	I then perceived also that this World was the greatest Part covered with a huge mighty Sea, those Parts only being dry Land which are to us somewhat darker than the rest of her Body, I mean, what the Country People call, The Man in the Moon, and that Part which shines so bright is another Ocean besprinkled with Islands, which for their Smallness we cannot discern so far off		
A1502	the Splendor which appears to us in the Night, is nothing but the Reflection of the Sun-beams returned to us out of the Water as from a Lookinglass		
A1503	How much this disagrees with what our Philosophers teach in the Schools is evident: But alas, how many of their Errors hath Time and Experience in this our Age, and among other vain Conjectures		
A1504	Vanities, Fancies and Dreams		
A1505	mine Eyes have sufficiently informed me there is no such Thing		
A1506	for that Region of Fire, our Philosophers talk of, I heard no News of it, mine Eyes have sufficiently informed me there is no such Thing		
A1507	my Reckoning it seemed to be (as indeed it was) Tuesday, September 11, at which Time the Moon being two Days old was in the twentieth Degree of Libra		
A1508	many wonderful Things were presented to my Sight

A1516	I doubt they have their Fables as well as we, since our Historians never mention any earthly Man to have been in that World before myself, and much less to have returned again. I cannot therefore but condemn this Tradition as false and romantick		
A1517	I found Learning was in great Esteem among them		
A1518	they seem to detest Lying and Falshood

A1521	that the Globe of the Moon has likewise an attractive Power, yet so much weaker than the Earth, that if a Man do but spring upward with all his Strength, as Dancers do in shewing their Tricks, he will be able to mount fifty or sixty Foot high; and being then above all Attraction from the Moon's Earth, he falls down no more, but by the Help of these Fans, as with Wings, they convey themselves in the Air in a short Space, (though not quite so swift as Birds) whither they please		
A1522	By the Stateliness of his Palace, and the Reverence done him, I soon perceived his Greatness, and managed my Affairs in order to procure his Favour accordingly		
A1523	At my Entrance I fell on my Knees		
A1524	taking out my Jewels, I presented to the King seven Stones of several Sorts, a Diamond, a Ruby, an Emerald, a Saphire, a Topaz and an Opal		
A1525	which he accepted with Joy		
A1526	Then I offered the Queen and Prince some others		
A1527	He then embraced me with much Endearedness		
A1528	enquired divers Things by Signs, which I answered in the same manner to the best of my Skill		
A1529	he delivered me to the Guard of 100 of his Giants as I may well call them, strictly charging them, that I should want nothing fit for me; that they should suffer none of the Dwarf Lunars, or little Moon Men, to come near me		
A1530	That I should be instructed in their Language		
A1531	that they should by no Means impart to me the Knowledge of several Things by him specified, what they were I could never understand		
A1532	I answered as near the Truth as possible		
A1533	I was provided with all Necessaries as my Heart could wish, so that I seemed to be in a Paradise		
A1534	I was much concerned with the Thoughts of my Wife and Children		
A1535	Secret and irresistible Decree of Nature		
A1536	You must understand, that of the true Lunars or Moon Men there are three Kinds		
A1537	he orders all Things through the Globe of the Moon in Matters or Religion, as absolutely as the Pope doth in any Part of Italy;		
A1538	I then applied myself to learning the Language		
A1539	is the same throughout all the Regions of the Moon		
A1540	Their Language is very difficult, since it hath no Affinity with any other I ever heard, and consists not so much of Words and Letters, as Tunes and strange Sounds which no Letters can express, for there are few Words but signify several Things, and are distinguished only by their Sounds, which are sung as it were in uttering; yea many Words consist of Tunes only, without Words		
A1541	Notwithstanding these Difficulties, within two Months I attained to such Knowledge therein		
A1542	was pleased to inform me of many Things my Guardians durst not disclose		
A1543	I must needs say I never found they abused me with an Untruth, but if I asked a Question they were unwilling to resolve, they would shake their Heads, and with a Spanish Shrug divert to some other Discourse		
A1544	I presented him the Remainder of my Jewels		
A1545	he thankfully accepted

A1547	Gifts of a far more considerable Value		
A1548	The Gifts he bestowed on me were such, that a Man would part with Mountains of Gold to purchase		
A1549	this hath been the direct Opinion of divers antient, and some modern Mathematicians, and may probably be deduced from the Tenets of others, neither does it contradict any Principle of Reason nor Faith		
A1550	Knowledge		
A1551	that there should be Antipodes was once thought as great a Paradox, as now that the Moon should be habitable. But the Knowledge of it may be reserved for this our discovering Age, wherein our Virtuosi can by their Telescopes gaze the Sun into Spots, and descry Mountains in the Moon		
A1552	his Covetousness had like to have been my utter Ruin		
A1553	and give perfect Instructions how those almost incredible and impossible Acquirements may be imparted to the World.		
A1554	you shall then have the Discovery of a New World, and Abundance of rare and incredible Secrets of Nature, which the Philosophers of former Ages never so much as dreamt of		
A1555	I must be cautious in publishing these wonderful Mysteries, till our Statesmen have considered how they may consist with the Policy and good Government of our Country, and whether the Fathers of the Church may not judge the divulging them prejudicial to the Catholic Faith, which (by those Wonders I have seen above any mortal Man before me) I am instructed to advance without Respect to any temporal Advantage whatsoever.		
A1556	I had now, besides a Wife, two Sons, whom I was not willing to beggar, only to satisfy the avaritious Humour of this Boaster, and so was necessitated to take some other Course		
A1557	and so by hiding and shewing my Light according to the Agreement betwixt us, I certified him of what I pleased. In the Day I advertised him by Smoke, Dust, and other refined Ways.		
A1558	I had more Apprehension left Ambition, and the Desire of gaining to himself the Honour of so admirable an Invention, should tempt him to dispatch me		
A1559	I found then by Experience, what no Philosopher ever dreamt of, namely, that those Things we call heavy do not fall towards the Center of the Earth as their natural Place, but are drawn by a secret Property of the Globe of the Earth, or rather something within it, as the Load-stone draweth Iron, which is within the Compass of its attractive Beams		
A1560	allow the Earth its Motion, which these Eyes of mine can testify to be true, and all those Absurdities are removed, every one having only his own single and proper Motion.		
A1561	How much this disagrees with what our Philosophers teach in the Schools is evident: But alas, how many of their Errors hath Time and Experience in this our Age, and among other vain Conjectures, who hath not hitherto believed the upper Region of the Air to be very hot; as being next, forsooth, to the natural Place of the Element of Fire; meer Vanities, Fancies and Dreams		
A1562	as for that Region of Fire, our Philosophers talk of, I heard no News of it, mine Eyes have sufficiently informed me there is no such Thing.

A1565	rare Curiosity		
A1566	the queen gave birth to a girl who was so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy, and he ordered a great celebration		
A1567	but also the wise women so that they would be kindly disposed toward the child		
A1568	the wise women presented the child with their magic gifts		
A1569	presented the child with their magic gifts		
A1570	The one gave her virtue, the second one beauty, the third one wealth, and so on with everything that one could wish for on earth.		
A1571	"""In the princess's fifteenth year she shall prick herself with a spindle and fall over dead."""		
A1572	". Because she was unable to undo the wicked wish, but only to soften it, she said, ""It shall not be her death. The princess will only fall into a hundred-year deep sleep."""		
A1573	"""It shall not be her death. The princess will only fall into a hundred-year deep sleep."""

A1575	the princess's fifteenth year she shall prick herself with a spindle and fall over dead.		
A1576	The king, wanting to rescue his dear child, issued an order that all spindles in the entire kingdom should be burned.		
A1577	The wise women's gifts were all fulfilled on the girl, for she was so beautiful, well behaved, friendly, and intelligent that everyone who saw her had to love her.		
A1578	"""What is that thing that is so merrily bouncing about?"" asked the girl, taking hold of the spindle, for she too wanted to spin."		
A1579	when the magic curse was fulfilled, and she pricked herself in the finger.		
A1580	There she lay and was so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her.		
A1581	He bent over and gave her a kiss. When he touched her with the kiss Little Brier-Rose opened her eyes, awoke, and looked at him kindly.		
A1582	And then the prince's marriage to Little Brier-Rose was celebrated with great splendor, and they lived happily until they died.		
A1583	there was a sweet little girl.		
A1584	Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet.		
A1585	"""Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your grandmother. And when you enter her parlor, don't forget to say 'Good morning,' and don't peer into all the corners first"

A1589	She did not know what a wicked animal he was,		
A1590	"""Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should be good for her and give her strength."""		
A1591	"We baked yesterday, and they should be good for her and give her strength."""		
A1592	"""Now that sweet young thing is a tasty bite for me."		
A1593	"""Now that sweet young thing is a tasty bite for me. She will taste even better than the old woman. You must be sly, and you can catch them both."""		
A1594	f a take a fresh bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased. Anyway, it is still early, and I'll be home on time		
A1595	Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods.		
A1596	"""Little Red Cap. I'm bringing you some cake and wine. Open the door."""		
A1597	Then he put on her clothes, put her cap on his head, got into her bed, and pulled the curtains shut.		
A1598	Then he put on her clothes, put her cap on his head, got into her bed,		
A1599	Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and looking very strange.		
A1600	"""All the better to hear you with."""		
A1601	"""All the better to see you with."""		
A1602	"""All the better to grab you with!"""		
A1603	"""All the better to eat you with!"""		
A1604	The wolf had scarcely finished speaking when he jumped from the bed with a single leap and ate up poor Little Red Cap		
A1605	"A huntsman was just passing by. He thought, ""The old woman is snoring so loudly. You had better see if something is wrong with her."""		
A1606	"""The old woman is snoring so loudly. You had better see if something is wrong with her."""		
A1607	"He stepped into the parlor, and when he approached the bed, he saw the wolf lying there. ""So here I find you, you old sinner,"" he said. ""I have been hunting for you a long time."""		
A1608	He was about to aim his rifle when it occurred to him that the wolf might have eaten the grandmother, and that she still might be rescued. So instead of shooting, he took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the wolf's belly.		
A1609	Then Little Red Cap fetched some large stones. She filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he immediately fell down dead.		
A1610	The huntsman skinned the wolf and went home with the pelt.		
A1611	"""As long as I live, I will never leave the path and run off into the woods by myself if mother tells me not to."""		
A1612	They also tell how Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time,		
A1613	Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time,		
A1614	was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time		
A1615	"Soon afterward the wolf knocked on the door and called out, ""Open up, grandmother. It's Little Red Cap, and I'm bringing you some baked things."""		
A1616	"""Let's lock the door, so he can't get in."""		
A1617	"""Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap,"" she said to the child. ""Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough."""		
A1618	ittle Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned		
A1619	A year later the king took himself another wife.		
A1620	Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.		
A1621	"Then she summoned a huntsman and said to him, ""Take Snow-White out into the woods. I never want to see her again. Kill her, and as proof that she is dead bring her lungs and her liver back to me."""		
A1622	The huntsman obeyed		
A1623	The huntsman obeyed and took Snow-White into the woods		
A1624	He took out his hunting knife and was about to stab it into her innocent heart		
A1625	"""Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I will run into the wild woods and never come back."""		
A1626	"Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her, and he said, ""Run away, you poor child."""		
A1627	but still it was as if a stone had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her.		
A1628	for he would not have to kill her.		
A1629	still it was as if a stone had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her.		
A1630	Just then a young boar came running by. He killed it, cut out its lungs and liver, and took them back to the queen as proof of Snow-White's death		
A1631	He killed it, cut out its lungs and liver, and took them back to the queen as proof of Snow-White's death		
A1632	the wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver.		
A1633	supposing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver.		
A1634	and wild animals jumped at her, but they did her no harm		
A1635	They were so happy, that they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed.		
A1636	but let her continue to sleep there in the bed.		
A1637	let her continue to sleep there in the bed		
A1638	"But they were friendly and asked, ""What is your name?"""		
A1639	Then she told them that her stepmother had tried to kill her, that the huntsman had spared her life		
A1640	her stepmother had tried to kill her, that the huntsman had spared her life		
A1641	she told them that her stepmother had tried to kill her, that the huntsman had spared her life		
A1642	had spared her life		
A1643	"""Yes,"" said Snow-White, ""with all my heart."""		
A1644	"""Yes,"" said Snow-White,"		
A1645	"aid Snow-White, ""with all my heart."		
A1646	Now the queen, believing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver,		
A1647	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.		
A1648	This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie,		
A1649	she realized that the huntsman had deceived her, and that Snow-White was still alive		
A1650	how she could kill Snow-White, for as long as long as she was not the most beautiful woman in the entire land her envy would give her no rest.		
A1651	The queen took fright and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour on whenever she looked at Snow-White her heart turned over inside her body, so great was her hatred for the girl.		
A1652	Coloring her face, she disguised herself as an old peddler woman, so that no one would recognize her.		
A1653	"""Good day, dear woman, what do you have for sale?"""		
A1654	"""I can let that honest woman in,"" thought Snow-White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty bodice lace."		
A1655	The unsuspecting Snow-White		
A1656	"""The old peddler woman was no one else but the godless queen"		
A1657	old peddler woman was no one else but the godless queen		
A1658	"Take care and let no one in when we are not with you."""		
A1659	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A1660	Then she disguised herself, taking the form of a different old woman.		
A1661	"Snow-White looked out and said, ""Go on your way. I am not allowed to let anyone in."""		
A1662	"""You surely may take a look,"" said the old woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it up. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door."		
A1663	. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door.		
A1664	"""Now let me comb your hair properly."""		
A1665	"""Snow-White shall die,"" she shouted, ""if it costs me my life!"""		
A1666	. From the outside it was beautiful, white with red cheeks, and anyone who saw it would want it. But anyone who might eat a little piece of it would died.		
A1667	she disguised herself as a peasant woman, and thus went across the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs		
A1668	"""I am not allowed to let anyone in. The dwarfs have forbidden me to do so."""		
A1669	Snow-White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the peasant woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half.		
A1670	You, my queen, are fairest of all.		
A1671	They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days.		
A1672	Snow-White lay there in the coffin a long, long time, and she did not decay, but looked like she was asleep,		
A1673	"Then he said to the dwarfs, ""Let me have the coffin. I will give you anything you want for it."" But the dwarfs answered, ""We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."""		
A1674	"I will honor her and respect her as my most cherished one."""		
A1675	As he thus spoke, the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him the coffin		
A1676	"""You are with me."" He told her what had happened, and then said, ""I love you more than anything else in the world. Come with me to my father's castle. You shall become my wife."" Snow-White loved him, and she went with him. Their wedding was planned with great splendor and majesty."		
A1677	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But the young queen is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A1678	Then they put a pair of iron shoes into burning coals. They were brought forth with tongs and placed before her. She was forced to step into the red-hot shoes and dance until she fell down dead.		
A1679	"when she felt that her end was drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said, ""Dear child, remain pious and good, and then our dear God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you."" With this she closed her eyes and died"		
A1680	They were beautiful, with fair faces, but evil and dark hearts		
A1681	"They took her beautiful clothes away from her, dressed her in an old gray smock, and gave her wooden shoes. ""Just look at the proud princess! How decked out she is!"" they shouted and laughed as they led her into the kitchen"		
A1682	"One day it happened that the father was going to the fair, and he asked his two stepdaughters what he should bring back for them. ""Beautiful dresses,"" said the one. ""Pearls and jewels,"" said the other. ""And you, Cinderella,"" he said, ""what do you want?"" ""Father, break off for me the first twig that brushes against your hat on your way home."""		
A1683	he gave his stepdaughters the things that they had asked for, and he gave Cinderella the twig from the hazel bush		
A1684	she wept so much that her tears fell upon it and watered it. It grew and became a beautiful tree		
A1685	"The good ones go into the pot,  The bad ones go into your crop."""		
A1686	"The girl took the bowl to her stepmother, and was happy, thinking that now she would be allowed to go to the festival with them. But the stepmother said, ""No, Cinderella, you have no clothes, and you don't know how to dance. Everyone would only laugh at you."""		
A1687	"then the stepmother said, ""You may go if you are able to pick two bowls of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour,"" thinking to herself, ""She will never be able to do that."""		
A1688	"""You tame pigeons, you turtledoves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to gather"		
A1689	Two white pigeons came in through the kitchen window, and then the turtledoves, and finally all the birds beneath the sky came whirring and swarming in, and lit around the ashes. The pigeons nodded their heads and began to pick, pick, pick, pick. And the others also began to pick, pick, pick, pick. They gathered all the good grains into the bowls. Before a half hour had passed they were finished, and they all flew out again

Hardly one hour had passed before they were finished, and they all flew out again		
A1691	"We would be ashamed of you."" With this she turned her back on Cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters"		
A1692	"The girl took the bowls to her stepmother, and was happy, thinking that now she would be allowed to go to the festival with them. But the stepmother said, ""It's no use. You are not coming with us, for you have no clothes, and you don't know how to dance"		
A1693	She quickly put on the dress and went to the festival		
A1694	Her stepsisters and her stepmother did not recognize her. They thought she must be a foreign princess, for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress. They never once thought it was Cinderella, for they thought that she was sitting at home in the dirt, looking for lentils in the ashes		
A1695	"She danced until evening, and then she wanted to go home. But the prince said, ""I will go along and escort you,"" for he wanted to see to whom the beautiful girl belonged. However, she eluded him and jumped into the pigeon coop"		
A1696	Cinderella had quickly jumped down from the back of the pigeon coop and had run to the hazel tree. There she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had taken them away again		
A1697	When evening came she wanted to leave, and the prince followed her, wanting to see into which house she went. But she ran away from him and into the garden behind the house		
A1698	When evening came Cinderella wanted to leave, and the prince tried to escort her, but she ran away from him so quickly that he could not follow her		
A1699	"Then her mother gave her a knife and said, ""Cut off your toe. When you are queen you will no longer have to go on foot."""		
A1700	The girl cut off her toe, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the prince. He took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her		
A1701	on the hazel tree, sat the two pigeons, crying out: Rook di goo, rook di goo! There's blood in the shoe. The shoe is too tight, This bride is not right!		
A1702	on the hazel tree, sat the two pigeons, crying out: Rook di goo, rook di goo! There's blood in the shoe. The shoe is too tight, This bride is not right! Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was running from it. He turned his horse around and took the false bride home again		
A1703	"her mother gave her a knife, and said, ""Cut a piece off your heel. When you are queen you will no longer have to go on foot."""

A1705	The girl cut a piece off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the prince. He took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her. When they passed the hazel tree, the two pigeons were sitting in it, and they cried out: Rook di goo, rook di goo! There's blood in the shoe. The shoe is too tight, This bride is not right! He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking all red. Then he turned his horse around and took the false bride home again		
A1706	"The prince told him to send her to him, but the mother answered, ""Oh, no, she is much too dirty. She cannot be seen."" But the prince insisted on it, and they had to call Cinderella"		
A1707	Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was running from it		
A1708	He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking all red		
A1709	"""This is not the right one, either,"" he said. ""Don't you have another daughter?"" ""No,"" said the man. ""There is only a deformed little Cinderella from my first wife, but she cannot possibly be the bride."""		
A1710	"When she stood up the prince looked into her face, and he recognized the beautiful girl who had danced with him. He cried out, ""She is my true bride."""		
A1711	the two white pigeons cried out: Rook di goo, rook di goo! No blood's in the shoe. The shoe's not too tight, This bride is right!		
A1712	After they had cried this out, they both flew down and lit on Cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there		
A1713	When the wedding with the prince was to be held, the two false sisters came, wanting to gain favor with Cinderella and to share her good fortune. When the bridal couple walked into the church, the older sister walked on their right side and the younger on their left side, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from each of them. Afterwards, as they came out of the church, the older one was on the left side, and the younger one on the right side, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye from each of them. And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness as long as they lived		
A1714	"""No, Cinderella, you have no clothes, and you don't know how to dance"		
A1715	When she arrived at the festival in this dress, everyone was so astonished that they did not know what to say		
A1716	"""The unknown girl has eluded me"		
A1717	the prince did not know where she had gone		
A1718	then he told him that the unknown girl had jumped into the pigeon coop		
A1719	And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness as long as they lived		
A1720	The girl went out to her mother's grave every day and wept, and she remained pious and good		
A1721	"""Dear child, remain pious and good, and then our dear God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you."""		
A1722	the man took himself another wife		
A1723	This wife brought two daughters into the house with her		
A1724	"""Why should that stupid goose sit in the parlor with us?"" they said. ""If she wants to eat bread, then she will have to earn it. Out with this kitchen maid!"""		
A1725	There she had to do hard work from morning until evening, get up before daybreak, carry water, make the fires, cook, and wash. Besides this, the sisters did everything imaginable to hurt her. They made fun of her, scattered peas and lentils into the ashes for her, so that she had to sit and pick them out again. In the evening when she had worked herself weary, there was no bed for her. Instead she had to sleep by the hearth in the ashes. And because she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her Cinderella		
A1726	So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls, and jewels for his two stepdaughters. On his way home, as he was riding through a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. Then he broke off the twig and took it with him. Arriving home, he gave his stepdaughters the things that they had asked for, and he gave Cinderella the twig from the hazel bush		
A1727	Cinderella thanked him, went to her mother's grave, and planted the branch on it		
A1728	Cinderella went to this tree three times every day, and beneath it she wept and prayed		
A1729	All the beautiful young girls in the land were invited, so that his son could select a bride for himself		
A1730	"The prince approached her, took her by the hand, and danced with her. Furthermore, he would dance with no one else. He never let go of her hand, and whenever anyone else came and asked her to dance, he would say, ""She is my dance partner."""		
A1731	"The old man thought, ""Could it be Cinderella?"" He had them bring him an ax and a pick so that he could break the pigeon coop apart, but no one was inside"		
A1732	He had them bring him an ax and a pick so that he could break the pigeon coop apart, but no one was inside		
A1733	When Cinderella appeared at the festival in this dress, everyone was astonished at her beauty		
A1734	"The prince had waited until she came, then immediately took her by the hand, and danced only with her. When others came and asked her to dance with them, he said, ""She is my dance partner."""		
A1735	"I believe she has climbed up the pear tree. The father thought, ""Could it be Cinderella?"" He had an ax brought to him and cut down the tree, but no one was in it"		
A1736	"The father thought, ""Could it be Cinderella?"" He had an ax brought to him and cut down the tree, but no one was in it"		
A1737	she had jumped down from the other side of the tree, had taken the beautiful dress back to the bird in the hazel tree, and had put on her gray smock		
A1738	"The prince danced only with her, and whenever anyone else asked her to dance, he would say, ""She is my dance partner."""		
A1739	The prince, however, had set a trap. He had had the entire stairway smeared with pitch. When she ran down the stairs, her left slipper stuck in the pitch		
A1740	"""No one shall be my wife except for the one whose foot fits this golden shoe."""		
A1741	He turned his horse around and took the false bride home again, saying that she was not the right one, and that the other sister should try on the shoe		
A1742	"Then he turned his horse around and took the false bride home again.  ""This is not the right one, either,"""		
A1743	"The prince told him to send her to him, but the mother answered, ""Oh, no, she is much too dirty. She cannot be seen."""		
A1744	She sat down on a stool, pulled her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, and it fitted her perfectly		
A1745	Once upon a time there was a sorcerer who disguised himself as a poor man, went begging from house to house		
A1746	No one knew where he took them, for none of them ever returned		
A1747	he simply touched her, and she was forced to jump into his pack basket		
A1748	when the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread, he simply touched her, and she was forced to jump into his pack basket		
A1749	He appeared to be a poor, weak beggar, and he carried a pack basket on his back, as though he wanted to collect some benevolent offerings in it. He asked for a bit to eat, and when the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread, he simply touched her, and she was forced to jump into his pack basket		
A1750	Here are the house keys. You may go everywhere and look at everything except for the one room that this little key here unlocks

A1756	"He also gave her an egg, saying, ""Take good care of this egg. You should carry it with you at all times, for if you should loose it great misfortune would follow."""		
A1757	She took the keys and the egg, and promised to take good care of everything		
A1758	Finally she came to the forbidden door. She wanted to pass it by, but curiosity gave her no rest		
A1759	"""You went into that chamber against my will,"" he said, ""and now against your will you shall go into it once again. Your life is finished."""		
A1760	"""Now I will go get the second one,"" said the sorcerer, and, again disguised as a poor man, he went to their house begging"		
A1761	The second sister brought him a piece of bread		
A1762	the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread		
A1763	He appeared to be a poor, weak beggar, and he carried a pack basket on his back, as though he wanted to collect some benevolent offerings in it. He asked for a bit to eat, and when the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread		
A1764	he saw from the red stain that she had been in the blood chamber		
A1765	He threw her down, dragged her by her hair into the chamber, cut off her head on the block, then cut her up into pieces, and her blood flowed out onto the floor. Then he threw her into the basin with the others		
A1766	he captured her by merely touching her, and he carried her away		
A1767	She let herself be led astray by her curiosity, opened the blood chamber and looked inside		
A1768	When he returned she paid with her life		
A1769	he went and captured the third sister, but she was clever and sly		
A1770	After he had given her the keys and the egg, and had gone away, she carefully put the egg aside, and then examined the house, entering finally the forbidden chamber		
A1771	In spite of this she proceeded to gather their parts together, placing them back in order: head, body, arms, and legs. Then, when nothing else was missing, the parts began to move		
A1772	"When the man returned home he immediately demanded the keys and the egg, and when he was unable to detect any trace of blood on them, he said, ""You have passed the test. You shall be my bride."""		
A1773	He now had no more power over her and had to do whatever she demanded		
A1774	"You shall be my bride."" He now had no more power over her and had to do whatever she demanded"		
A1775	"""Good,"" she answered, ""but first you must take a basketful of gold to my father and mother. You yourself must carry it there on your back. In the meanwhile I shall make preparations for the wedding."""		
A1776	"Then she ran to her sisters, whom she had hidden in a closet, and said, ""The moment is here when I can rescue you. The evildoer himself shall carry you home"		
A1777	"""The moment is here when I can rescue you. The evildoer himself shall carry you home. As soon as you have arrived at home send help to me."""		
A1778	She put them both into a basket, then covered them entirely with gold, so that nothing could be seen of them		
A1779	"Then she called the sorcerer in and said, ""Now carry this basket away, but you are not to stop and rest underway. Take care, for I shall be watching you through my little window."""		
A1780	He thought that his bride was calling to him, so he got up again		
A1781	"Then he again wanted to sit down, but someone immediately called out, ""I am looking through my little window, and I can see that you are resting. Walk on!"""		
A1782	"He sat down, wanting to rest, but immediately one of the girls in the basket called out, ""I am looking through my little window, and I can see that you are resting. Walk on!"""		
A1783	When everything was ready she dipped herself into a barrel of honey, then cut open the bed and rolled around in it until she looked like a strange bird, and no one would have been able to recognize her		
A1784	Then she walked out of the house		
A1785	Seeing the decorated skull, he thought it was his bride, and he waved a friendly greeting to her		
A1786	the bride's brothers and relatives arrived. They had been sent to rescue her		
A1787	After he and all his guests had gone into the house, the bride's brothers and relatives arrived. They had been sent to rescue her. After closing up all the doors of the house so that no one could escape, they set it afire, and the sorcerer, together with his gang, all burned to death		
A1788	He asked for a bit to eat, and when the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread, he simply touched her, and she was forced to jump into his pack basket. Then he hurried away with powerful strides and carried her to his house, which stood in the middle of a dark forest		
A1789	As soon as he had gone she walked about in the house from top to bottom examining everything		
A1790	She examined the key. It looked like any other one. She put it into the lock and twisted it a little, and then the door sprang open		
A1791	Oh, what she saw! He two dear sisters were lying there in the basin, miserably murdered and chopped to pieces. In spite of this she proceeded to gather their parts together, placing them back in order: head, body, arms, and legs. Then, when nothing else was missing, the parts began to move. They joined together, and the two girls opened their eyes and came back to life. Rejoicing, they kissed and hugged one another		
A1792	Every time that he stopped walking, someone called out, and he had to walk on until, groaning and out of breath, he brought the basket with the gold and the two girls to their parents' house		
A1793	At home the bride was making preparations for the wedding feast, to which she had had the sorcerer's friends invited. Then she took a skull with grinning teeth, adorned it with jewelry and with a wreath of flowers, carried it to the attic window, and let it look out		
A1794	"Underway some of the wedding guests met her, and they asked, ""You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from?"" ""I am coming from Fitcher's house."""		
A1795	"""You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from?"" ""I am coming from Fitcher's house."		
A1796	"""Why do you torment yourself with chopping wood? I will make you rich if you will promise me that which is standing behind your mill."""		
A1797	"When he arrived home, his wife came up to him and said, ""Miller, tell me, where did all the wealth come from that is suddenly in our house? All at once all the chests and boxes are full, and no one brought it here, and I don't know where it came from."""		
A1798	"All at once all the chests and boxes are full, and no one brought it here, and I don't know where it came from."""		
A1799	"""Oh, husband!"" said the woman, terrified. ""That was the devil. He didn't mean the apple tree, but our daughter, who was just then standing behind the mill sweeping the yard."""		
A1800	The miller's daughter was a beautiful and pious girl, and she lived the three years worshipping God and without sin		
A1801	When the time was up and the day came when the evil one was to get her, she washed herself clean and drew a circle around herself with chalk		
A1802	The devil appeared very early in the morning, but he could not approach her		
A1803	"""Keep water away from her, so she cannot wash herself any more. Otherwise I have no power over her."""		
A1804	The miller was frightened and did what he was told. The next morning the devil returned, but she had wept into her hands, and they were entirely clean		
A1805	"Thus he still could not approach her, and he spoke angrily to the miller, ""Chop off her hands. Otherwise I cannot get to her."" Â The miller was horrified and answered, ""How could I chop off my own child's hands!"""		
A1806	"Â The miller was horrified and answered, ""How could I chop off my own child's hands!"" Then the evil one threatened him, saying, ""If you do not do it, then you will be mine, and I will take you yourself."""		
A1807	"She answered, ""Dear father, do with me what you will. I am your child,"" and with that she stretched forth both hands and let her father chop them off"		
A1808	Compassionate people will give me as much as I need		
A1809	she had her mutilated arms tied to her back, and at sunrise she set forth, walking the entire day until it was night		
A1810	"The miller spoke to her, ""I have gained great wealth through you. I shall take care of you in splendor as long as you live."""		
A1811	inside there were trees full of beautiful fruit. But she could not get inside, for there it was surrounded by water		
A1812	He closed a head gate, so that the moat dried up, and she could walk through		
A1813	Then she kneeled down and, crying out to God the Lord, she prayed. Suddenly an angel appeared		
A1814	She entered the garden, and the angel went with her		
A1815	The gardener saw it happen, but because the angel was standing by her he was afraid and thought that the girl was a spirit		
A1816	She saw a fruit tree with beautiful pears, but they had all been counted. She stepped up to the tree and ate from it with her mouth, enough to satisfy her hunger, but no more		
A1817	"The king who owned this garden came the next morning. He counted the fruit and saw that one of the pears was missing. He asked the gardener what had happened to it. It was not lying under the tree, but had somehow disappeared. The gardener answered, ""Last night a spirit came here. It had no hands and ate one of the pears with its mouth."""		
A1818	"The king said, ""How did the spirit get across the water? And where did it go after it had eaten the pear?"""		
A1819	"The king said, ""If what you said is true, I will keep watch with you tonight."""		
A1820	After it was dark the king entered the garden, bringing a priest with him who was to talk to the spirit		
A1821	After it was dark the king entered the garden, bringing a priest with him who was to talk to the spirit. All three sat down under the tree and kept watch		
A1822	"The priest walked up to them and said, ""Have you come from God, or from the world? Are you a spirit or a human?"" She answered, ""I am not a spirit, but a poor human who has been abandoned by everyone except God."""		
A1823	"She answered, ""I am not a spirit, but a poor human who has been abandoned by everyone except God."""		
A1824	"The king said, ""Even if you have been abandoned by the whole world, I will not abandon you."""		
A1825	She gave birth to a beautiful son. The old mother quickly wrote this in a letter, giving the joyful news to the king		
A1826	He still wanted to harm the pious queen		
A1827	he took the letter, putting in its place one that stated that the queen had brought a changeling into the world		
A1828	The devil came again and placed a different letter in his bag. This letter said that they should kill the queen with her child		
A1829	She could not believe it, and wrote to the king again, but she got back the same answer, because each time the devil substituted a false letter		
A1830	The old mother lamented that such innocent blood was to be shed, and in the night she had a doe killed, cut out its tongue and eyes, and had them put aside		
A1831	"Then she said to the queen, ""I cannot have you killed as the king has ordered, but you can no longer stay here. Go out into the wide world with your child, and never come back."""		
A1832	She came to a great, wild forest where she got onto her knees and prayed to God. Then the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a small house		
A1833	Then the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a small house		
A1834	"On it was a small sign with the words, ""Here anyone can live free."""		
A1835	"Then the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a small house. On it was a small sign with the words, ""Here anyone can live free."""		
A1836	She untied the small boy from her back, held him to her breast so he could drink, and then laid him in a beautiful made-up bed		
A1837	She stayed in this house for seven years, and was well taken care of		
A1838	And through the grace of God and her own piety her chopped-off hands grew back		
A1839	"Then the old mother began to weep, saying, ""You wicked man, why did you write to me that I was to put two innocent souls to death,"" and she showed him the two letters that the evil one had counterfeited. Then she continued to speak, ""I did what you ordered,"" and showed him as proof the eyes and the tongue"		
A1840	"Then she continued to speak, ""I did what you ordered,"" and showed him as proof the eyes and the tongue"		
A1841	"Then the king began to weep even more bitterly for his poor wife and his little son, until the old woman had mercy and said to him, ""Be satisfied that she is still alive. I secretly had a doe killed and took the proofs from it. I tied your wife's child onto her back and told her to go out into the wide world, and she had to promise never to come back here, because you were so angry with her."""		
A1842	He neither ate nor drank during the entire time, but God kept him alive		
A1843	"Finally he came to a great forest, where he found a little house with a sign containing the words, "" Here anyone can live free."""		
A1844	"He answered, ""I have been traveling about for nearly seven years looking for my wife and her child, but I cannot find them."""		
A1845	The angel offered him something to eat and drink, but he did not take it, wanting only to rest a little		
A1846	The angel offered him something to eat and drink		
A1847	"""Mother, dear, how can I cover my father's face? I have no father in this world. I have learned to pray, 'Our father which art in heaven,' and you have said that my father is in heaven, and that he is our dear God. How can I know such a wild man? He is not my father."""		
A1848	"Then she said, ""Filled-with-Grief, pick up the cloth for your father and put it over his face again."" The child picked it up and put it over his face again"		
A1849	"She said, ""I am your wife, and this is your son Filled-with-Grief."" He saw her living hands and said, ""My wife had silver hands."""		
A1850	"The angel went into the other room, brought back the silver hands, and showed them to him. Now he saw for sure that it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed them, and rejoiced, and said, ""A heavy stone has fallen from my heart."""		
A1851	Then the angel of God gave them all something to eat		
A1852	they went back home to his old mother. There was great joy everywhere, and the king and the queen conducted their wedding ceremony once again, and they lived happily until their blessed end		
A1853	He took her home with him to his royal castle, and because she was so beautiful and pure he loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her, and took her as his wife		
A1854	Then the devil came to him. He still wanted to harm the pious queen		
A1855	The king finally came back home from the battlefield, and the first thing he wanted to do was to see his wife and their child		
A1856	"Then the king said, ""I will go as far as the sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have found my dear wife and my child again, provided that in the meantime they have not died or perished from hunger."""		
A1857	Then the king traveled about for nearly seven years, searching in all the stone cliffs and caves, but he did not find her, and he thought that she had perished		
A1858	All at once all the chests and boxes are full, and no one brought it here, and I don't know where it came from.		
A1859	"""How did you know that I am a queen?"""		
A1860	"She said, ""I am your wife, and this is your son Filled-with-Grief."""		
A1861	"One day he had gone into the forest to gather wood, where he was approached by an old man, whom he had never seen before, and who said, ""Why do you torment yourself with chopping wood? I will make you rich if you will promise me that which is standing behind your mill."" ""What can that be but my apple tree?"" thought the miller, said yes, and signed it over to the strange man"		
A1862	This frightened the father, and he promised to obey him		
A1863	"""My child, if I do not chop off both of your hands, then the devil will take me away, and in my fear I have promised him to do this"		
A1864	"Help me in my need, and forgive me of the evil that I am going to do to you."""		
A1865	The devil came a third time, but she had wept so long and so much onto the stumps, that they were entirely clean		
A1866	The devil came a third time, but she had wept so long and so much onto the stumps, that they were entirely clean. Then he had to give up, for he had lost all claim to her		
A1867	by the light of the moon she saw that inside there were trees full of beautiful fruit		
A1868	"Having walked the entire day without eating a bite, she was suffering from hunger, and she thought, ""Oh, if only I were inside the garden so I could eat of those fruits. Otherwise I shall perish."""		
A1869	She saw a fruit tree with beautiful pears, but they had all been counted		
A1870	She stepped up to the tree and ate from it with her mouth, enough to satisfy her hunger, but no more		
A1871	"""What can that be but my apple tree?"" thought the miller, said yes, and signed it over to the strange man. The latter, however, laughed mockingly and said, ""I will come in three years and get what belongs to me,"" then went away"		
A1872	"He answered, ""It comes from an strange man whom I met in the woods and who promised me great treasures if I would but sign over to him that which stands behind the mill. We can give up the large apple tree for all this."" ""Oh, husband!"" said the woman, terrified. ""That was the devil. He didn't mean the apple tree, but our daughter, who was just then standing behind the mill sweeping the yard."""		
A1873	The miller's daughter was a beautiful and pious girl, and she lived the three years worshipping God and without sin. When the time was up and the day came when the evil one was to get her, she washed herself clean and drew a circle around herself with chalk		
A1874	The next morning the devil returned, but she had wept into her hands, and they were entirely clean		
A1875	"she answered, ""I cannot remain here. I will go away"		
A1876	"""Someone dressed in snow-white came from heaven and closed the head gate so the spirit could walk through the moat. Because it must have been an angel I was afraid, and I asked no questions, and I did not call out. After the spirit had eaten the pear it went away again."""		
A1877	"She answered, ""I am not a spirit, but a poor human who has been abandoned by everyone except God."" The king said, ""Even if you have been abandoned by the whole world, I will not abandon you."""		
A1878	The devil came again and placed a different letter in his bag. This letter said that they should kill the queen with her child. The old mother was terribly frightened when she received this letter. She could not believe it, and wrote to the king again, but she got back the same answer, because each time the devil substituted a false letter		
A1879	"The white virgin came out, took him by the hand, led him inside, and said, ""Welcome, King,"" then asked him where he had come from"		
A1880	"The angel said to her, ""Go into the next room with your child. Your husband has come."""		
A1881	"The angel said to her, ""Go into the next room with your child. Your husband has come."" She went to where he was lying"		
A1882	"He saw her living hands and said, ""My wife had silver hands."" She answered, ""Our merciful God has caused my natural hands to grow back."""		
A1883	"After a year the king had to go out into the battlefield, and he left the young queen in the care of his mother, saying, ""If she has a child, support her and take good care of her, and immediately send me the news in a letter."""		
A1884	"One evening as he was lying in bed worrying about his problems, he sighed and said to his wife, ""What is to become of us? How can we feed our children when we have nothing for ourselves?"" ""Man, do you know what?"" answered the woman. ""Early tomorrow morning we will take the two children out into the thickest part of the woods, make a fire for them, and give each of them a little piece of bread, then leave them by themselves and go off to our work. They will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of them."" ""No, woman,"" said the man. ""I will not do that. How could I bring myself to abandon my own children alone in the woods? Wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces."" ""Oh, you fool,"" she said, ""then all four of us will starve. All you can do is to plane the boards for our coffins."" And she gave him no peace until he agreed. ""But I do feel sorry for the poor children,"" said the man."		
A1885	"""Be quiet, Gretel,"" said Hansel, ""and don't worry. I know what to do."""		
A1886	Hansel had not been looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his pocket onto the path		
A1887	Because they could hear the blows of an ax, they thought that the father was nearby. However, it was not an ax. It was a branch that he had tied to a dead tree and that the wind was beating back and forth		
A1888	"They knocked on the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, ""You wicked children, why did you sleep so long in the woods? We thought that you did not want to come back."" But the father was overjoyed when he saw his children once more, for he had not wanted to leave them alone"		
A1889	"The man was very disheartened, and he thought, ""It would be better to share the last bit with the children."" But the woman would not listen to him, scolded him, and criticized him"		
A1890	He who says A must also say B, and because he had given in the first time, he had to do so the second time as well		
A1891	"But he comforted his little sister and said, ""Don't cry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will help us."""		
A1892	"""I can see my pigeon sitting on the roof. It wants to say good-bye to me."" ""Fool,"" said the woman, ""that isn't your pigeon. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."""		
A1893	When it was midday Gretel shared her bread with Hansel		
A1894	Nibble, nibble, little mouse, Who is nibbling at my house? The children answered: The wind, the wind, The heavenly child.		
A1895	She took them by the hand and led them into her house. Then she served them a good meal: milk and pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterward she made two nice beds for them, decked in white. Hansel and Gretel went to bed, thinking they were in heaven. But the old woman had only pretended to be friendly. She was a wicked witch who was lying in wait there for children. She had built her house of bread only in order to lure them to her, and if she captured one, she would kill him, cook him, and eat him; and for her that was a day to celebrate		
A1896	But Hansel stuck out a little bone, and the old woman, who had bad eyes and could not see the bone, thought it was Hansel's finger, and she wondered why he didn't get fat		
A1897	In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones		
A1898	"The duckling came up to them, and Hansel climbed onto it, then asked his little sister to sit down next to him.  ""No,"" answered Gretel. ""That would be too heavy for the duckling. It should take us across one at a time."""		
A1899	Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets		
A1900	"""You fool, that isn't your cat. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."""		
A1901	"""Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way."""		
A1902	But the father was overjoyed when he saw his children once more, for he had not wanted to leave them alone		
A1903	Now Hansel was given the best things to eat every day, but Gretel received nothing but crayfish shells		
A1904	"""But now we must leave,"" said Hansel, ""and get out of these witch-woods."""		
A1905	The man had not had even one happy hour since he had left the children in the woods. However, the woman had died		
A1906	Now all their cares were at an end, and they lived happily together		
A1907	I know what to do		
A1908	they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching		
A1909	"she got up, went to their beds, and looked at the two of them lying there so peacefully, with their full red cheeks. ""They will be a good mouthful,"" she mumbled to herself"		
A1910	"""We cannot get across,"" said Hansel. ""I cannot see a walkway or a bridge."" ""There are no boats here,"" answered Gretel, ""but there is a white duck swimming. If I ask it, it will help us across."""		
A1911	"She pushed poor Gretel outside to the oven, from which fiery flames were leaping. ""Climb in,"" said the witch, ""and see if it is hot enough to put the bread in yet."" And when Gretel was inside, she intended to close the oven, and bake her, and eat her as well. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, so she said, ""I don't know how to do that. How can I get inside?"" ""Stupid goose,"" said the old woman. The opening is big enough. See, I myself could get in."" And she crawled up stuck her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a shove, causing her to fall in"		
A1912	Gretel put the bread under her apron, because Hansel's pockets were full of stones		
A1913	as soon as the adults had fallen asleep, he got up, pulled on his jacket, opened the lower door, and crept outside. The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house were glistening like silver coins. Hansel bent over and filled his jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit		
A1914	"""Don't worry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will not forsake us."" Then he went back to bed"		
A1915	"Then she gave each one a little piece of bread, saying, ""Here is something for midday. Don't eat it any sooner, for you'll not get any more."""		
A1916	Then all together they set forth into the woods		
A1917	"The father said, ""Hansel, why are you stopping and looking back? Pay attention now, and don't forget your legs."""		
A1918	"""Oh, father,"" said Hansel, ""I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and wants to say good-bye to me."" The woman said, ""You fool, that isn't your cat. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."""		
A1919	"""Oh, father,"" said Hansel, ""I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and wants to say good-bye to me."" The woman said, ""You fool, that isn't your cat. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."" However, Hansel had not been looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his pocket onto the path."		
A1920	"When they arrived in the middle of the woods, the father said, ""You children gather some wood, and I will make a fire so you won't freeze."""		
A1921	"The twigs were set afire, and when the flames were burning well, the woman said, ""Lie down by the fire and rest. We will go into the woods to cut wood. When we are finished, we will come back and get you."""		
A1922	"Hansel comforted her, ""Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way."""		
A1923	After the full moon had come up, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles that glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked throughout the entire night, and as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father's house		
A1924	They received their little pieces of bread		
A1925	On the way to the woods, Hansel crumbled his piece in his pocket, then often stood still, and threw crumbs onto the ground		
A1926	"""Hansel, why are you always stopping and looking around?"" said his father. ""Keep walking straight ahead."""		
A1927	"Once again a large fire was made, and the mother said, ""Sit here, children. If you get tired you can sleep a little. We are going into the woods to cut wood. We will come and get you in the evening when we are finished."""		
A1928	"""Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home."""		
A1929	"""Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home."" When the moon appeared they got up, but they could not find any crumbs, for the many thousands of birds that fly about in the woods and in the fields had pecked them up"		
A1930	"Hansel said to Gretel, ""We will find our way,"" but they did not find it"		
A1931	"Hansel and Gretel were so frightened that they dropped what they were holding in their hands.  But the old woman shook her head and said, ""Oh, you dear children, who brought you here? Just come in and stay with me. No harm will come to you."""		
A1932	Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far		
A1933	Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching		
A1934	Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch's house		
A1935	When the adults were asleep, Hansel got up again and wanted to gather pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out		
A1936	"Once upon a time there was a rich man who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly. Every morning he was the first one out of bed, and at night the last one to go to bed. Whenever there was a difficult job that nobody wanted to do, he was always the first to volunteer. He never complained at any of this, but was contented with everything and always happy. When his year was over, his master gave him no wages, thinking, ""That is the smartest thing to do, for it will save me something. He won't leave me, but will gladly stay here working for me."""		
A1937	The servant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had done before, and when at the end of this year he again received no wages, he still stayed on without complaining. When the third year had passed, the master thought it over, then put his hand into his pocket, but pulled out nothing		
A1938	"When the third year had passed, the master thought it over, then put his hand into his pocket, but pulled out nothing. However, this time the servant said, ""Master, I have served you honestly for three years. Be so good as to give me what by rights I have coming to me. I would like to be on my way and see something else of the world."""		
A1939	"""Master, I have served you honestly for three years. Be so good as to give me what by rights I have coming to me. I would like to be on my way and see something else of the world."""		
A1940	"The good servant, who understood little about money, put his wealth into his pocket, and thought, ""Ah, now that I have a full purse, why should I worry and continue to plague myself with hard work?"" So he set forth, uphill and down, singing and jumping for joy"		
A1941	"""Why should I be sad?"" answered the servant. ""I have everything I need. Three years' wages are jingling in my pocket"		
A1942	"""Listen,"" said the dwarf, ""I am a poor and needy man. Give me your three hellers. I can no longer work, but you are young and can easily earn your bread."""		
A1943	"""Listen,"" said the dwarf, ""I am a poor and needy man. Give me your three hellers. I can no longer work, but you are young and can easily earn your bread."" Now because the servant had a good heart and felt pity for the dwarf, he gave him his three hellers, saying, ""In God's name, I won't miss them."" Then the dwarf said, ""Because I see that you have a good heart I will grant you three wishes, one for each heller. They shall all be fulfilled."""		
A1944	"""Rogue,"" he said to the Jew, ""Go and fetch the bird out for yourself."" ""My goodness,"" said the Jew, ""don't call me a rogue, sir, but I will be the dog and get the bird out for myself. After all, you're the one who shot it."""		
A1945	"But the servant did not listen to him, and thought, ""You have fleeced people often enough, and now the thorn hedge shall do the same to you."" He began to play all over again, so that the Jew had to jump even higher, leaving scraps from his coat hanging on the thorns. ""Oh, woe is me!"" cried the Jew. ""I will give the gentleman anything he asks, if only he quits fiddling, even a purse filled with gold."""		
A1946	"""Judge, sir,"" he said"		
A1947	The judge asked		
A1948	"""God forbid,"" said the Jew. ""He didn't have a naked dagger, but rather a blowpipe hanging from his back, and a fiddle from his neck. The scoundrel can easily be recognized."""		
A1949	The judge sent his people out after him. They found the good servant, who had been walking along quite slowly. And they found the purse with the money on him as well		
A1950	"When he was brought before the judge he said, ""I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money"		
A1951	He offered it to me freely		
A1952	"""God forbid!"" cried the Jew. ""He is reaching for lies like flies on the wall."""		
A1953	"The judge did not believe his story, and said, ""That is a poor excuse. No Jew would do that."""		
A1954	"The judge did not believe his story, and said, ""That is a poor excuse. No Jew would do that."		
A1955	And because he had committed robbery on the open road, the good servant was sentenced to the gallows		
A1956	When he was brought before the judge he said		
A1957	he ran into the town to the judge		
A1958	"""Yes,"" said the judge, ""if you do not ask for your life."""		
A1959	"The servant walked quietly up the ladder with the hangman, but on the last rung he turned around and said to the judge, ""Grant me just one request before I die."" ""Yes,"" said the judge, ""if you do not ask for your life."""		
A1960	"But the judge said, ""Why should I not grant him this short pleasure? It has been promised to him, and he shall have it."""		
A1961	In any event, he could not have refused because of the gift that had been bestowed on the servant		
A1962	the judge, the clerks, and the court officials		
A1963	The hangman released the good servant and made ready to dance		
A1964	The judge and the Jew were out in front and were the best at jumping		
A1965	Soon everyone who had gathered in the marketplace out of curiosity was dancing with them, old and young, fat and thin, all together with each other. Even the dogs that had run along with the crowd stood up on their hind legs and hopped along as well		
A1966	the judge, quite out of breath, shouted		
A1967	"""I will give you your life, but just stop fiddling."""		
A1968	"Finally the judge, quite out of breath, shouted, ""I will give you your life, but just stop fiddling."" The good servant listened to this, then took his fiddle, hung it around his neck again, and climbed down the ladder"		
A1969	"He went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground gasping for air, and said, ""You rogue, now confess where you got the money, or I will take my fiddle off my neck and begin to play again."""		
A1970	With that the judge had the Jew led to the gallows and hanged as a thief		
A1971	"He went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground gasping for air, and said, ""You rogue, now confess where you got the money, or I will take my fiddle off my neck and begin to play again."" ""I stole it. I stole it,"" he cried. ""But you have honestly earned it."""		
A1972	At the second stroke they all lifted their legs		
A1973	At the third stroke everyone jumped up and began to dance		
A1974	The longer he played, the higher the dancers jumped		
A1975	Then he lay down on the ground and began crawling into the thicket. When he was in the middle of the thorns, the good servant could not resist the temptation to pick up his fiddle and begin to play. The Jew's legs immediately began to move, and he jumped up. The more the servant fiddled the better went the dance. However, the thorns ripped apart the Jew's shabby coat, combed his beard, and pricked and pinched him all over his body		
A1976	"But the servant did not listen to him, and thought, ""You have fleeced people often enough, and now the thorn hedge shall do the same to you."" He began to play all over again, so that the Jew had to jump even higher, leaving scraps from his coat hanging on the thorns. ""Oh, woe is me!"" cried the Jew. ""I will give the gentleman anything he asks, if only he quits fiddling, even a purse filled with gold."" ""If you are so generous,"" said the servant, ""then I will stop my music. But I must praise the singular way that you dance to it."" Then he took his purse he went on his way."		
A1977	"""Oh, woe is me! See how a godless man has robbed me and abused me on the open road. A stone on the ground would feel sorry for me. My clothes are ripped into shreds. My body is pricked and scratched to pieces. And what little I owned has been taken away with my purse -- genuine ducats, each piece more beautiful than the others. For God's sake, let the man be thrown into prison."""		
A1978	"For God's sake, let the man be thrown into prison."""		
A1979	"""Was it a soldier who cut you up like that with his saber?"""		
A1980	"""Was it a soldier who cut you up like that with his saber?"" ""God forbid,"" said the Jew. ""He didn't have a naked dagger, but rather a blowpipe hanging from his back, and a fiddle from his neck. The scoundrel can easily be recognized."""		
A1981	"""I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money. He offered it to me freely, so that I would stop fiddling, because he could not stand my music."" ""God forbid!"" cried the Jew. ""He is reaching for lies like flies on the wall."""		
A1982	"""Grant me just one request before I die."" ""Yes,"" said the judge, ""if you do not ask for your life."""		
A1983	"""For God's sake, do not allow it! Do not allow it!"""		
A1984	"The Jew cried, ""Oh, woe is me! Tie me up. Tie me up tightly."" The good servant took his fiddle from his neck, and made ready"		
A1985	As he played the first stroke, they all began to quiver and shake		
A1986	"""Master, I have served you honestly for three years. Be so good as to give me what by rights I have coming to me"		
A1987	Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other dearly		
A1988	they had no children, though they wished very much to have some, and the woman prayed for them day and night		
A1989	they had no children, though they wished very much to have some, and the woman prayed for them day and night, but they didn't get any, and they didn't get any		
A1990	"""Oh,"" said the woman. She sighed heavily, looked at the blood before her, and was most unhappy. ""If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow."" And as she said that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen"		
A1991	Then the fifth month passed, and she stood beneath the juniper tree, which smelled so sweet that her heart jumped for joy, and she fell on her knees and was beside herself. And when the sixth month was over, the fruit was thick and large, and then she was quite still. And after the seventh month she picked the juniper berries and ate them greedily. Then she grew sick and sorrowful		
A1992	"Then the eighth month passed, and she called her husband to her, and cried, and said, ""If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper tree."" Then she was quite comforted and happy until the next month was over, and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she saw it, she was so happy that she died"		
A1993	Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree, and he began to cry bitterly. After some time he was more at ease, and although he still cried, he could bear it. And some time later he took another wife		
A1994	When the woman looked at her daughter, she loved her very much, but then she looked at the little boy, and it pierced her heart, for she thought that he would always stand in her way, and she was always thinking how she could get the entire inheritance for her daughter. And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace		
A1995	And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace		
A1996	"One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, when her little daughter came up too, and said, ""Mother, give me an apple."" ""Yes, my child,"" said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest"		
A1997	"This made the woman angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school."""		
A1998	"""Mother,"" said the little daughter, ""is brother not to have one too?"" This made the woman angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school."""		
A1999	"Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, ""My son, do you want an apple?"""		
A2000	"""Come with me,"" she said, opening the lid of the chest. ""Take out an apple for yourself."" And while the little boy was leaning over, the Evil One prompted her, and crash! she slammed down the lid, and his head flew off, falling among the red apples"		
A2001	she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white scarf out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen. Then she set him on a chair in front of the door and put the apple in his hand		
A2002	Marlene came into the kitchen to her mother, who was standing by the fire with a pot of hot water before her which she was stirring around and around		
A2003	"""Mother,"" said Marlene, ""brother is sitting at the door, and he looks totally white and has an apple in his hand. I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was very frightened."" ""Go back to him,"" said her mother, ""and if he will not answer you, then box his ears."" So Marlene went to him and said, ""Brother, give me the apple."" But he was silent, so she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, ""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted"		
A2004	"So Marlene went to him and said, ""Brother, give me the apple."" But he was silent, so she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, ""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted"		
A2005	"""Marlene,"" said the mother, ""what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it. It cannot be helped now. We will cook him into stew."""		
A2006	"""Oh,"" said the man, ""I am unhappy. It isn't right. He should have said good-bye to me."" With that he began to eat, saying, ""Marlene, why are you crying? Your brother will certainly come back."""		
A2007	"Then he said, ""Wife, this food is delicious. Give me some more."" And the more he ate the more he wanted, and he said, ""Give me some more. You two shall have none of it. It seems to me as if it were all mine."" And he ate and ate, throwing all the bones under the table, until he had finished it all"		
A2008	Marlene went to her chest of drawers, took her best silk scarf from the bottom drawer, and gathered all the bones from beneath the table and tied them up in her silk scarf, then carried them outside the door, crying tears of blood. She laid them down beneath the juniper tree on the green grass, and after she had put them there, she suddenly felt better and did not cry anymore		
A2009	"""Marlene,"" said the mother, ""what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it. It cannot be helped now. We will cook him into stew."" Then the mother took the little boy and chopped him in pieces, put him into the pot, and cooked him into stew. But Marlene stood by crying and crying, and all her tears fell into the pot, and they did not need any salt."		
A2010	"Then the father said again, ""Where is my son?"" ""Oh,"" said the mother, ""he has gone across the country to his mother's great uncle. He will stay there awhile."" ""What is he doing there? He did not even say good-bye to me."" ""Oh, he wanted to go, and asked me if he could stay six weeks. He will be well taken care of there."""		
A2011	My mother, she killed me, My father, he ate me, My sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I		
A2012	"Then he called in at his door, ""Wife, come outside"		
A2013	Then he called his daughter and her children, and the journeyman, and the apprentice, and the maid, and they all came out into the street		
A2014	and they all came out into the street and looked at the bird and saw how beautiful he was, and what fine red and green feathers he had, and how his neck was like pure gold, and how his eyes shone like stars in his head		
A2015	"He walked onward, then stood still and said to the bird, ""Bird,"" he said, ""how beautifully you can sing. Sing that piece again for me."" ""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the golden chain, and then I will sing it again for you."""		
A2016	"""Bird,"" said the shoemaker, ""now sing that song again for me."" ""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. You must give me something."""		
A2017	"""Wife,"" said the man, ""go into the shop. There is a pair of red shoes on the top shelf. Bring them down."" Then the wife went and brought the shoes"		
A2018	In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack		
A2019	My mother, she killed me		
A2020	Then one of them stopped working		
A2021	My father, he ate me		
A2022	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf		
A2023	"Then the last one stopped also, and heard the last words. ""Bird,"" said he, ""how beautifully you sing. Let me hear that too. Sing it once more for me."""		
A2024	"Then the last one stopped also, and heard the last words. ""Bird,"" said he, ""how beautifully you sing. Let me hear that too. Sing it once more for me."" ""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the millstone, and then I will sing it again."""		
A2025	"""Yes,"" he said, ""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" ""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."""		
A2026	"The father said, ""I feel so contented. I am so happy."" ""Not I,"" said the mother, ""I feel uneasy, just as if a bad storm were coming."" But Marlene just sat and cried and cried"		
A2027	"the father said, ""Oh, I feel so truly happy, and the sun is shining so beautifully outside. I feel as if I were about to see some old acquaintance again."" ""Not I,"" said the woman, ""I am so afraid that my teeth are chattering, and I feel like I have fire in my veins."" And she tore open her bodice even more. Marlene sat in a corner crying. She held a handkerchief before her eyes and cried until it was wet clear through"		
A2028	The mother stopped her ears and shut her eyes, not wanting to see or hear, but there was a roaring in her ears like the fiercest storm, and her eyes burned and flashed like lightning		
A2029	"""Oh, mother,"" said the man"		
A2030	"""Oh, mother,"" said the man, ""that is a beautiful bird. He is singing so splendidly, and the sun is shining so warmly, and it smells like pure cinnamon."" My sister Marlene, Then Marlene laid her head on her knees and cried and cried, but the man said, ""I am going out. I must see the bird up close."""		
A2031	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I		
A2032	"Then the man went in and said, ""Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks."" But the woman was terrified. She fell down on the floor in the room, and her cap fell off her head"		
A2033	"My mother killed me. ""I wish I were a thousand fathoms beneath the earth, so I would not have to hear that!"""		
A2034	My father, he ate me, Then the woman fell down as if she were dead		
A2035	"""Oh,"" she said, ""I was so sad when I went out and now I am so contented"		
A2036	"""No,"" said the woman, jumping to her feet and with her hair standing up like flames of fire, ""I feel as if the world were coming to an end. I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better."""		
A2037	And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death		
A2038	when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate		
A2039	"She threw the apple into the chest, and shut it. Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, ""My son, do you want an apple?"" And she looked at him fiercely"		
A2040	"Then the father came home, and sat down at the table and said, ""Where is my son?"" And the mother served up a large, large dish of stew"		
A2041	a mist seemed to rise from the tree, and in the center of this mist it burned like a fire, and a beautiful bird flew out of the fire singing magnificently, and it flew high into the air, and when it was gone, the juniper tree was just as it had been before, and the cloth with the bones was no longer there		
A2042	Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it		
A2043	"It isn't right. He should have said good-bye to me."""		
A2044	"In past times there were a king and a queen, who said every day, ""Oh, if only we had a child!"" but they never received one"		
A2045	He invited not only his relatives, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women so that they would be kindly disposed toward the child		
A2046	He invited not only his relatives, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women so that they would be kindly disposed toward the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but because he had only twelve golden plates from which they were to eat, one of them had to remain at home		
A2047	"The eleventh one had just pronounced her blessing when the thirteenth one suddenly walked in. She wanted to avenge herself for not having been invited, and without greeting anyone or even looking at them she cried out with a loud voice, ""In the princess's fifteenth year she shall prick herself with a spindle and fall over dead."""		
A2048	the wise women presented the child with their magic gifts. The one gave her virtue, the second one beauty, the third one wealth, and so on with everything that one could wish for on earth		
A2049	the king and the queen were not at home, and the girl was all alone in the castle		
A2050	"""What is that thing that is so merrily bouncing about?"" asked the girl, taking hold of the spindle, for she too wanted to spin. She had no sooner touched the spindle when the magic curse was fulfilled, and she pricked herself in the finger"		
A2051	Brier-Rose		
A2052	Legends also told that from time to time princes came, wanting to force their way through the hedge into the castle. However, they did not succeed, for the thorns held firmly together, as though they had hands, and the young men became stuck in them, could not free themselves, and died miserably		
A2053	However much the good old man tried to dissuade him, the prince would not listen to his words		
A2054	the cook in the kitchen was still holding up his hand as if he wanted to grab the boy, and the maid was sitting in front of the black chicken that was supposed to be plucked		
A2055	When he touched her with the kiss Little Brier-Rose opened her eyes, awoke, and looked at him kindly		
A2056	They went downstairs together		
A2057	And then the prince's marriage to Little Brier-Rose was celebrated with great splendor, and they lived happily until they died		
A2058	He heard an old man telling about the thorn hedge. It was said that there was a castle behind it, in which a beautiful princess named Little Brier-Rose had been asleep for a hundred years, and with her the king and the queen and all the royal attendants were sleeping. He also knew from his grandfather that many princes had come and tried to penetrate the thorn hedge, but they had become stuck in it and died a sorrowful death		
A2059	When the prince approached the thorn hedge, it was nothing but large, beautiful flowers that separated by themselves, allowing him to pass through without harm, but then behind him closed back into a hedge		
A2060	The cook, who was about to pull kitchen boy's hair for having done something wrong, let him loose and fell asleep		
A2061	Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap		
A2062	"One day her mother said to her, ""Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your grandmother. And when you enter her parlor, don't forget to say 'Good morning,' and don't peer into all the corners first."" ""I'll do everything just right,"" said Little Red Cap, shaking her mother's hand"		
A2063	She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him		
A2064	"""Her house is good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place,"" said Little Red Cap"		
A2065	"The wolf thought to himself, ""Now that sweet young thing is a tasty bite for me. She will taste even better than the old woman. You must be sly, and you can catch them both."" He walked along a little while with Little Red Cap, then he said, ""Little Red Cap, just look at the beautiful flowers that are all around us. Why don't you go and take a look? And I don't believe you can hear how beautifully the birds are singing. You are walking along as though you were on your way to school. It is very beautiful in the woods."""		
A2066	But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door		
A2067	"""If a take a fresh bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased"		
A2068	"""Who's there?"" ""Little Red Cap. I'm bringing you some cake and wine. Open the door."" ""Just press the latch,"" called out the grandmother. ""I'm too weak to get up."" The wolf pressed the latch, and the door opened. He stepped inside, went straight to the grandmother's bed, and ate her up. Then he put on her clothes, put her cap on his head, got into her bed, and pulled the curtains shut"		
A2069	"""Oh, my God, why am I so afraid? I usually like it at grandmother's."""		
A2070	Then she went to the bed and pulled back the curtains. Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and looking very strange		
A2071	"""Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!"" ""All the better to hear you with."" ""Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!"" ""All the better to see you with."" ""Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!"" ""All the better to grab you with!"" ""Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have!"" ""All the better to eat you with!"""		
A2072	He was about to aim his rifle when it occurred to him that the wolf might have eaten the grandmother, and that she still might be rescued. So instead of shooting, he took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the wolf's belly		
A2073	And then the grandmother came out as well, alive but hardly able to breathe. Then Little Red Cap fetched some large stones. She filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he immediately fell down dead. The three of them were happy		
A2074	Then Little Red Cap fetched some large stones. She filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he immediately fell down dead. The three of them were happy		
A2075	He stepped into the parlor, and when he approached the bed, he saw the wolf lying there		
A2076	They also tell how Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time, when another wolf spoke to her and wanted her to leave the path. But Little Red Cap took care and went straight to grandmother's		
A2077	"She told her that she had seen the wolf, and that he had wished her a good day, but had stared at her in a wicked manner. ""If we hadn't been on a public road, he would have eaten me up,"" she said"		
A2078	"""Come,"" said the grandmother. ""Let's lock the door, so he can't get in."""		
A2079	"Soon afterward the wolf knocked on the door and called out, ""Open up, grandmother. It's Little Red Cap, and I'm bringing you some baked things."" They remained silent, and did not open the door"		
A2080	"But the grandmother saw what he was up to. There was a large stone trough in front of the house. ""Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap,"" she said to the child. ""Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough."" Little Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned"		
A2081	"Gray-Head crept around the house several times, and finally jumped onto the roof. He wanted to wait until Little Red Cap went home that evening, then follow her and eat her up in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what he was up to. There was a large stone trough in front of the house. ""Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap,"" she said to the child. ""Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough."" Little Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned. And Little Red Cap returned home happily, and no one harmed her"		
A2082	"""Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap,"" she said to the child. ""Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough."" Little Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned"		
A2083	They remained silent, and did not open the door		
A2084	Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next		
A2085	she came to be known as Little Red Cap		
A2086	"Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your grandmother. And when you enter her parlor, don't forget to say 'Good morning,' and don't peer into all the corners first."" ""I'll do everything just right,"" said Little Red Cap, shaking her mother's hand"		
A2087	"A huntsman was just passing by. He thought, ""The old woman is snoring so loudly. You had better see if something is wrong with her."" He stepped into the parlor, and when he approached the bed, he saw the wolf lying there"		
A2088	as soon as the child was born, the queen died		
A2089	Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth		
A2090	she knew that the mirror spoke the truth		
A2091	it is true		
A2092	she had no peace day and night		
A2093	Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her		
A2094	"Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her, and he said, ""Run away, you poor child."" He thought, ""The wild animals will soon devour you anyway,"" but still it was as if a stone had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her"		
A2095	"He took out his hunting knife and was about to stab it into her innocent heart when she began to cry, saying, ""Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I will run into the wild woods and never come back."""		
A2096	Then she began to run. She ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and wild animals jumped at her, but they did her no harm. She ran as far as her feet could carry her, and just as evening was about to fall she saw a little house and went inside in order to rest		
A2097	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White is a thousand times fairer than you		
A2098	"The huntsman obeyed and took Snow-White into the woods. He took out his hunting knife and was about to stab it into her innocent heart when she began to cry, saying, ""Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I will run into the wild woods and never come back."" Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her, and he said, ""Run away, you poor child."""		
A2099	"He thought, ""The wild animals will soon devour you anyway,"" but still it was as if a stone had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her"		
A2100	"The first one said, ""Who has been sitting in my chair?"" The second one, ""Who has been eating from my plate?"" The third one, ""Who has been eating my bread?"" The fourth one, ""Who has been eating my vegetables?"" The fifth one, ""Who has been sticking with my fork?"" The sixth one, ""Who has been cutting with my knife?"" The seventh one, ""Who has been drinking from my mug?"" Then the first one saw a that there was a little imprint in his bed, and said, ""Who stepped on my bed?"" The others came running up and shouted, ""Someone has been lying in mine as well."""		
A2101	The seventh dwarf had to sleep with his companions, one hour with each one		
A2102	they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed		
A2103	"when she saw the seven dwarfs she was frightened. But they were friendly and asked, ""What is your name?"""		
A2104	there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with snow-white sheets		
A2105	Snow-White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate, and from each mug she drank a drop of wine		
A2106	"""If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want."""		
A2107	in the evening when they came back home their meal had to be ready. During the day the girl was alone		
A2108	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you		
A2109	she knew that the mirror did not lie		
A2110	This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie, and she realized that the huntsman had deceived her, and that Snow-White was still alive		
A2111	Coloring her face, she disguised herself as an old peddler woman, so that no one would recognize her		
A2112	"Knocking on the door she called out, ""Beautiful wares for sale, for sale!"" Snow-White peered out the window and said, ""Good day, dear woman, what do you have for sale?"""		
A2113	"""I can let that honest woman in,"" thought Snow-White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty bodice lace"		
A2114	The unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and let her do up the new lace, but the old woman pulled so quickly and so hard that Snow-White could not breathe		
A2115	Take care and let no one in when we are not with you		
A2116	all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow-White had come back to life		
A2117	Then she disguised herself, taking the form of a different old woman		
A2118	"""I can let that honest woman in,"" thought Snow-White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty bodice lace. ""Child,"" said the old woman, ""how you look! Come, let me lace you up properly."" The unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and let her do up the new lace, but the old woman pulled so quickly and so hard that Snow-White could not breathe"		
A2119	The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door		
A2120	"After they had agreed on the purchase, the old woman said, ""Now let me comb your hair properly."""		
A2121	"After they had agreed on the purchase, the old woman said, ""Now let me comb your hair properly."" She had barely stuck the comb into Snow-White's hair when the poison took effect, and the girl fell down unconscious"		
A2122	Fortunately it was almost evening, and the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw Snow-White lying on the ground as if she were dead, they immediately suspected her stepmother. They examined her and found the poisoned comb. They had scarcely pulled it out when Snow-White came to herself again and told them what had happened. Once again they warned her to be on guard and not to open the door for anyone		
A2123	Then she went into her most secret room -- no one else was allowed inside -- and she made a poisoned, poisoned apple		
A2124	From the outside it was beautiful, white with red cheeks, and anyone who saw it would want it. But anyone who might eat a little piece of it would died		
A2125	"Snow-White stuck her head out the window and said, ""I am not allowed to let anyone in. The dwarfs have forbidden me to do so."" ""That is all right with me,"" answered the peasant woman. ""I'll easily get rid of my apples. Here, I'll give you one of them."" ""No,"" said Snow-White, ""I cannot accept anything."" ""Are you afraid of poison?"" asked the old woman. ""Look, I'll cut the apple in two. You eat the red half, and I shall eat the white half."" Now the apple had been so artfully made that only the red half was poisoned. Snow-White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the peasant woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half"		
A2126	Snow-White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the peasant woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half. She barely had a bite in her mouth when she fell to the ground dead		
A2127	Now the apple had been so artfully made that only the red half was poisoned		
A2128	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? To this the mirror answered: You, my queen, are fairest of all. Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth		
A2129	The cook had to boil them with salt, and the wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver		
A2130	"""If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want."" ""Yes,"" said Snow-White, ""with all my heart."""		
A2131	Inside the house everything was small, but so neat and clean that no one could say otherwise		
A2132	She stepped before her mirror and said: Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? It answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you. This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie, and she realized that the huntsman had deceived her, and that Snow-White was still alive		
A2133	When the wicked woman returned home she went to her mirror and asked: Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? The mirror answered once again: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you. When she heard that, all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow-White had come back to life		
A2134	"Snow-White looked out and said, ""Go on your way. I am not allowed to let anyone in."" ""You surely may take a look,"" said the old woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it up. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door"		
A2135	They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days		
A2136	They lifted her up and looked for something poisonous. They undid her laces. They combed her hair. They washed her with water and wine. But nothing helped. The dear child was dead, and she remained dead. They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days. They were going to bury her, but she still looked as fresh as a living person, and still had her beautiful red cheeks		
A2137	"They said, ""We cannot bury her in the black earth,"""		
A2138	"They said, ""We cannot bury her in the black earth,"		
A2139	"""We cannot bury her in the black earth,"" and they had a transparent glass coffin made, so she could be seen from all sides"		
A2140	Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain, and one of them always stayed with it and watched over her		
A2141	The animals too came and mourned for Snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and finally a dove		
A2142	Then they put a pair of iron shoes into burning coals. They were brought forth with tongs and placed before her. She was forced to step into the red-hot shoes and dance until she fell down dead		
A2143	I Do here most humbly lay this small Present at Your Majesties Royal feet		
A2144	it comes accompany’d with two disadvantages, the meanness of the Author, and of the Subject		
A2145	the greatness of your Mercy and your Knowledge		
A2146	you can forgive the most presumptuous Offendors:		
A2147	you will not esteem the least work of Nature, or Art, unworthy your Observation		
A2148	Philosophy and Experimental Learning have prosper’d under your Royal Patronage.		
A2149	the Fruits of them should, by way of acknowledgement, be return’d to your Majesty.		
A2150	The Improvement of Manufactures and Agriculture, the Increase of Commerce, the Advantage of Navigation: In all which they are assisted by your Majesties Incouragement and Example. Amidst all those greater Designs, I here presume to bring in that which is more proportionable to the smalness of my Abilities, and to offer some of the least of all visible things, to that Mighty King, that has establisht an Empire over the best of all Invisible things of this World, the Minds of Men.		
A2151	most humble and most obedient		
A2152	most obedient		
A2153	I could not but think my self oblig’d, in consideration of those many Ingagements you have laid upon me, to offer these my poor Labours to this MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ASSEMBLY.		
A2154	The Rules YOU have prescrib’d YOUR selves in YOUR Philosophical Progress do seem the best that have ever yet been practis’d.		
A2155	avoiding Dogmatizing, and the espousal of any Hypothesis not sufficiently grounded and confirm’d by Experiments		
A2156	grounded and confirm’d by Experiments

A2161	It is the great prerogative of Mankind above other Creatures, that we are not only able to behold the works of Nature, or barely to sustein our lives by them, but we have also the power of considering, comparing, altering, assisting, and improving them to various uses.		
A2162	able to behold the works of Nature		
A2163	to sustein our lives by them, but we have also the power of considering, comparing, altering, assisting, and improving them to various uses		
A2164	this is the peculiar priviledge of humane Nature in general,		
A2165	By the addition of such artificial Instruments and methods, there may be, in some manner, a reparation made for the mischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self		
A2166	a reparation made for the mischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self		
A2167	deriv’d corruption, innate and born with him, and from his breeding and converse with men, is very subject to slip into all sorts of errors.

A2169	upon the evidence, the strength, the integrity, and the right correspondence of all these, all the light, by which our actions are to be guided is to be renewed, and all our command over things is to be establisht.		
A2170	It is therefore most worthy of our consideration, to recollect their several defects, that so we may the better understand how to supply them, and by what assistances we may inlarge their power, and secure them in performing their particular duties.		
A2171	from error in the Perception, that many things, which come within their reach, are not received in a right manner.		
A2172	a great part is either frivolous or false;		
A2173	The two main foundations being so deceivable,		
A2174	all the succeeding works which we build upon them, of arguing, concluding, defining, judging, and all the other degrees of Reason, are lyable to the same imperfection,		
A2175	either vain, or uncertain		
A2176	rrors of the understanding are answerable to the two other, being defective both in the quantity and goodness of its knowledge		
A2177	not having a full sensation of the Object, we must be very lame and imperfect in our conceptions about it		
A2178	we often take the shadow of things for the substance, small appearances for good similitudes, similitudes for definitions; and even many of those, which we think, to be the most solid definitions, are rather expressions of our own misguided apprehensions then of the true nature of the things themselves.		
A2179	some they incline to gross ignorance and stupidity		
A2180	presumptuous imposing on other mens Opinions, and a confident dogmatizing on matters, whereof there is no assurance to be given.

A2185	These being the dangers in the process of humane Reason		
A2186	he remedies of them all can only proceed from the real, the mechanical, the experimental Philosophy		
A2187	that chiefly aims at the subtilty of its Deductions and Conclusions		
A2188	this intends the right ordering of them all, and the making them serviceable to each other.		
A2189	The first thing to be undertaken in this weighty work, is a watchfulness over the failings and an inlargement of the dominion, of the Senses.		
A2190	watchfulness over the failings and an inlargement of the dominion, of the Senses.		
A2191	there should be a scrupulous choice, and a strict examination, of the reality, constancy, and certainty of the Particulars that we admit		
A2192	This is the first rise whereon truth is to begin		
A2193	The next care to be taken, in respect of the Senses, is a supplying of their infirmities with Instruments,		
A2194	as it were, the adding of artificial Organs to the natural; this in one of them has been of late years accomplisht with prodigious benefit to all sorts of useful knowledge,		
A2195	By this means the Heavens are open’d, and a vast number of new Stars, and new Motions, and new Productions appear in them, to which all the antient Astronomers were utterly Strangers.		
A2196	by these helps the subtilty of the composition of Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various texture of their matter, the instruments and manner of their inward motions, and all the other possible appearances of things, may come to be more fully discovered		
A2197	by these helps		
A2198	all which the antient Peripateticks were content to comprehend in two general and (unless further explain’d) useless words of Matter and Form.		
A2199	Operative, and the Mechanick Knowledge, to which this Age seems so much inclined,		
A2200	Operative		
A2201	we may perhaps be inabled to discern all the secret workings of Nature,		
A2202	two general and (unless further explain’d) useless words of Matter and Form.		
A2203	I hope, they may be in some measure useful to the main Design of a reformation in Philosophy

A2205	depth of Contemplation		
A2206	strength of Imagination		
A2207	sincere Hand		
A2208	faithful Eye, to examine, and to record, the things themselves as they appear.		
A2209	let me take the boldness to assure him		
A2210	in this present condition of knowledge		
A2211	only with resolution, and integrity,		
A2212	plain intentions of imploying his Senses aright		
A2213	may venture to compare the reality and the usefulness of his services, towards the true Philosophy		
A2214	with those of other men, that are of much stronger, and more acute speculations, that shall not make use of the same method by the Senses.		
A2215	The truth is, the Science of Nature has been already too long made only a work of the Brain and the Fancy		
A2216	It is now high time that it should return to the plainness and soundness of Observations on material and obvious things		
A2217	wandring far away into invisible Notions, has almost quite destroy’d it self		
A2218	wandring far away into invisible Notions,		
A2219	returning into the same sensible paths, in which it did at first proceed		
A2220	If therefore the Reader expects from me any infallible Deductions, or certainty of Axioms, I am to say for my self, that those stronger Works of Wit and Imagination are above my weak Abilities; or if they had not been so, I would not have made use of them in this present Subject before me		
A2221	I beseech him to look upon them only as doubtful Problems, and uncertain ghesses, and not as unquestionable Conclusions, or matters of unconfutable Science		
A2222	I am so far from that, that I desire him, not absolutely to rely upon these Observations of my eyes, if he finds them contradicted by the future Ocular Experiments of sober and impartial Discoverers		
A2223	if he finds them contradicted by the future Ocular Experiments of sober and impartial Discoverers		
A2224	I have obtained my end, if these my small Labours shall be thought fit to take up some place in the large stock of natural Observations, which so many hands are busie in providing		
A2225	If I have contributed the meanest foundations whereon others may raise nobler Superstructures, I am abundantly satisfied; and all my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me; that I may prepare and furnish them with some Materials, which they may afterwards order and manage with better skill, and to far greater advantage		
A2226	As for my part, I have obtained my end, if these my small Labours shall be thought fit to take up some place in the large stock of natural Observations, which so many hands are busie in providing.

A2228	as to avoid the dangers to which it is by nature most subject.		
A2229	consist of such Directions as may inform us, what things are best to be stor’d up for our purpose

A2241	It must not incroach upon their Offices, nor take upon it self the employments which belong to either of them		
A2242	It must watch the irregularities of the Senses, but it must not go before them, or prevent their information		
A2243	it must be sure to make distinction between the sober and well collected heap, and the extravagant Ideas, and mistaken Images, which there it may sometimes light upon		
A2244	it is to begin with the Hands and Eyes		
A2245	to be continued by the Reason		
A2246	to come about to the Hands and Eyes again		
A2247	by a continual passage round from one Faculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength, as much as the body of man is by the circulation of the blood through the several parts of the body, the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head		
A2248	the links, upon which the true Philosophy depends, of which, if any one be loose, or weak, the whole chain is in danger of being dissolv’d; it is to begin with the Hands and Eyes, and to proceed on through the Memory, to be continued by the Reason; nor is it to stop there, but to come about to the Hands and Eyes again, and so, by a continual passage round from one Faculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength, as much as the body of man is by the circulation of the blood through the several parts of the body, the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head		
A2249	If once this method were followed with diligence and attention, there is nothing that lyes within the power of human Wit (or which is far more effectual) of human Industry, which we might not compass

A2253	give place to solid Histories		
A2254	give place to solid Histories, Experiments		
A2255	not only by beholding and contemplating, but by tasting too those fruits of Natural knowledge, that were never yet forbidden		
A2256	the World may be assisted with variety of Inventions, new matter for Sciences may be collected, the old improv’d, and their rust rubb’d away		
A2257	The Indeavours of Skilful men have been most conversant about the assistance of the Eye		
A2258	that there is a way open’d for advancing the operations, not only of all the other Senses, but even of the Eye it self		
A2259	that which has been already done ought not to content us, but rather to incourage us to proceed further, and to attempt greater things in the same and different wayes		
A2260	Tis not unlikely, but that there may be yet invented several other helps for the eye, at much exceeding those already found, as those do the bare eye, such as by which we may perhaps be able to discover living Creatures in the Moon, or other Planets, the figures of the compounding Particles of matter, and the particular Schematisms and Textures of Bodies		
A2261	tis not improbable, but that there may be found many Mechanical Inventions to improve our other Senses, of hearing, smelling, tasting, touching		
A2262	there may be found many Mechanical Inventions		
A2263	though some famous Authors have affirm’d it impossible to hear through the thinnest plate of Muscovy-glass; yet I know a way, by which ’tis easie enough to hear one speak through a wall a yard thick		
A2264	I can assure the Reader, that I have, by the help of a distended wire, propagated the sound to a very considerable distance in an instant		
A2265	Nor are the other three so perfect, but that diligence, attention, and many mechanical contrivances, may also highly improve them.		
A2266	diligence, attention,		
A2267	many mechanical contrivances,		
A2268	something of this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the Air		
A2269	who knows, but that the Industry of man, following this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet higher.		
A2270	There may be also some other mechanical wayes found out, of sensibly perceiving the effluvia of Bodies; several Instances of which, were it here proper, I could give of Mineral steams and exhalations; and it seems not impossible, but that by some such wayes improved, may be discovered, what Minerals lye buried under the Earth, without the trouble to dig for them; some things to confirm this Conjecture may be found in Agricola, and other Writers of Minerals, speaking of the Vegetables that are apt to thrive, or pine, in those steams.  Whether also those steams, which seem to issue out of the Earth, and mix with the Air (and so to precipitate some aqueous Exhalations, wherewith ’tis impregnated) may not be by some way detected before they produce the effect, seems hard to determine; yet something of this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the Air; by which I constantly find, that before, and during the time of rainy weather, the pressure of the Air is less, and in dry weather, but especially when an Eastern Wind (which having past over vast tracts of Land is heavy with Earthy Particles) blows, it is much more, though these changes are varied according to very odd Laws.  The Instrument is this. I prepare a pretty capacious Bolt-head AB, with a small stem about two foot and a half long DC; upon the end of this D I put on a small bended Glass, or brazen syphon DEF (open at D, E and F, but to be closed with cement at F and E, as occasion serves) whose stem F should be about six or eight inches long, but the bore of it not above half an inch diameter, and very even; these I fix very strongly together by the help of very hard Cement, and then fit the whole Glass ABCDEF into a long Board, or Frame, in such manner, that almost half the head AB may lye buried in a concave Hemisphere cut into the Board RS; Schem. 1. Fig. 1. then I place it so on the Board RS, as is exprest in the first figure of the first Scheme; and fix it very firm and steady in that posture, so as that the weight of the Mercury that is afterwards to be put into it, may not in the least shake or stir it; then drawing a line XY on the Frame RT, so that it may divide the ball into two equal parts, or that it may pass, as ’twere, through the center of the ball. I begin from that, and divide all the rest of the Board towards UT into inches, and the inches between the 25 and the end E (which need not be above two or three and thirty inches distant from the line XY) I subdivide into Decimals; then stopping the end F with soft Cement, or soft Wax, I invert the Frame, placing the head downwards, and the Orifice E upwards; and by it, with a small Funnel, I fill the whole Glass with Quicksilver; then by stopping the small Orifice E with my finger, I oftentimes erect and invert the whole Glass and Frame, and thereby free the Quicksilver and Glass from all the bubbles or parcels of lurking Air; then inverting it as before, I fill it top full with clear and well strain’d Quicksilver, and having made ready a small ball of pretty hard Cement, by heat made very soft, I press it into the hole E, and thereby stop it very fast; and to secure this Cement from flying out afterward, I bind over it a piece of Leather, that is spread over in the inside with Cement, and wound about it while the Cement is hot: Having thus fastned it, I gently erect again the Glass after this manner: I first let the Frame down edge-wayes, till the edge RV touch the Floor, or ly horizontal; and then in that edging posture raise the end RS; this I do, that if there chance to be any Air hidden in the small Pipe E, it may ascend into the Pipe F, and not into the Pipe DC: Having thus erected it, and hung it by the hole Q, or fixt it perpendicularly by any other means, I open the end F, and by a small Syphon I draw out the Mercury so long, till I find the surface of it AB in the head to touch exactly the line XY; at which time I immediately take away the Syphon, and if by chance it be run somewhat below the line XY, by pouring in gently a little Mercury at F, I raise it again to its desired height, by this contrivance I make all the sensible rising and falling of the Mercury to be visible in the surface of the Mercury in the Pipe F, and scarce any in the head AB. But because there really is some small change of the upper surface also, I find by several Observations how much it rises in the Ball, and falls in the Pipe F, to make the distance between the two surfaces an inch greater then it was before; and the measure that it falls in the Pipe is the length of the inch by which I am to mark the parts of the Tube F, or the Board on which it lyes, into inches and Decimals: Having thus justned and divided it, I have a large Wheel MNOP, whose outmost limb is divided into two hundred equal parts; this by certain small Pillars is fixt on the Frame RT, in the manner exprest in the Figure. In the middle of this, on the back side, in a convenient frame, is placed a small Cylinder, whose circumference is equal to twice the length of one of those divisions, which I find answer to an inch of ascent, or descent, of Mercury: This Cylinder I, is movable on a very small Needle, on the end of which is fixt a very light Index KL, all which are so pois’d on the Axis, or Needle, that no part is heavier then another: Then about this Cylinder is wound a small Clew of Silk, with two small steel Bullets at each end of it GH; one of these, which is somewhat the heavier, ought to be so big, as freely to move to and fro in the Pipe F; by means of which contrivance, every the least variation of the height of the Mercury will be made exceeding visible by the motion to and fro of the small Index KL.  But this is but one way of discovering the effluvia of the Earth mixt with the Air; there may be perhaps many others, witness the Hygroscope, an Instrument whereby the watery steams volatile in the Air are discerned, which the Nose it self is not able to find. This I have describ’d in the following Tract in the Description of the Beard of a wild Oat. Others there are, may be discovered both by the Nose, and by other wayes also. Thus the smoak of burning Wood is smelt, seen, and sufficiently felt by the eyes: The fumes of burning Brimstone are smelt and discovered also by the destroying the Colours of Bodies, as by the whitening of a red Rose: And who knows, but that the Industry of man, following this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet higher.  ’Tis not improbable also, but that our taste may be very much improv’d, either by preparing our taste for the Body, as, after eating bitter things, Wine, or other Vinous liquors, are more sensibly tasted; or else by preparing Bodies for our tast; as the dissolving of Metals with acid Liquors, make them tastable, which were before altogether insipid; thus Lead becomes sweeter then Sugar, and Silver more bitter then Gall, Copper and Iron of most loathsome tasts. And indeed the business of this sense being to discover the presence of dissolved Bodies in Liquors put on the Tongue, or in general to discover that a fluid body has some solid body dissolv’d in it, and what they are; whatever contrivance makes this discovery improves this sense. In this kind the mixtures of Chymical Liquors afford many Instances; as the sweet Vinegar that is impregnated with Lead may be discovered to be so by the affusion of a little of an Alcalizate solution: The bitter liquor of Aqua fortis and Silver may be discover’d to be charg’d with that Metal, by laying in it some plates of Copper: ’Tis not improbable also, but there may be multitudes of other wayes of discovering the parts dissolv’d, or dissoluble in liquors; and what is this discovery but a kind of secundary tasting.  ’Tis not improbable also, but that the sense of feeling may be highly improv’d, for that being a sense that judges of the more gross and robust motions of the Particles of Bodies, seems capable of being improv’d and assisted very many wayes. Thus for the distinguishing of Heat and Cold, the Weather-glass and Thermometer, which I have describ’d in this following Treatise, do exceedingly perfect it; by each of which the least variations of heat or cold, which the most Acute sense is not able to distinguish, are manifested. This is oftentimes further promoted also by the help of Burning-glasses, and the like, which collect and unite the radiating heat. Thus the roughness and smoothness of a Body is made much more sensible by the help of a Microscope, then by the most tender and delicate Hand. Perhaps, a Physitian might, by several other tangible proprieties, discover the constitution of a Body as well as by the Pulse. I do but instance in these, to shew what possibility there may be of many others, and what probability and hopes there were of finding them, if this method were followed; for the Offices of the five Senses being to detect either the subtil and curious Motions propagated through all pellucid or perfectly homogeneous Bodies; Or the more gross and vibrative Pulse communicated through the Air and all other convenient mediums, whether fluid or solid: Or the effluvia of Bodies dissolv’d in the Air; Or the particles of bodies dissolv’d or dissoluble in Liquors, or the more quick and violent shaking motion of heat in all or any of these: whatsoever does any wayes promote any of these kinds of criteria, does afford a way of improving some one sense. And what a multitude of these would a diligent Man meet with in his inquiries? And this for the helping and promoting the sensitive faculty only.  Next, as for the Memory, or retentive faculty, we may be sufficiently instructed from the written Histories of civil actions, what great assistance may be afforded the Memory, in the committing to writing things observable in natural operations. If a Physitian be therefore accounted the more able in his Faculty, because he has had long experience and practice, the remembrance of which, though perhaps very imperfect, does regulate all his after actions: What ought to be thought of that man, that has not only a perfect register of his own experience, but is grown old with the experience of many hundreds of years, and many thousands of men.  And though of late, men, beginning to be sensible of this convenience, have here and there registred and printed some few Centuries, yet for the most part they are set down very lamely and imperfectly, and, I fear, many times not so truly, they seeming, several of them, to be design’d more for Ostentation then publique use: For, not to instance, that they do, for the most part, omit those Experiences they have made, wherein their Patients have miscarried, it is very easie to be perceiv’d, that they do all along hyperbolically extol their own Prescriptions, and vilifie those of others. Notwithstanding all which, these kinds of Histories are generally esteem’d useful, even to the ablest Physitian		
A2271	What may not be expected from the rational or deductive Faculty that is furnisht with such Materials		
A2272	How neer the nature of Axioms must all those Propositions be which are examin’d before so many Witnesses?		
A2273	And how difficult will it be for any, though never so subtil an error in Philosophy, to scape from being discover’d, after it has indur’d the touch, and so many other tryals?		
A2274	The Invention of a way to find the Longitude of places is easily perform’d, and that to as great perfection as is desir’d, or to at great an accurateness as the Latitude of places can be found at Sea; and perhaps yet also to a greater certainty then that has been hitherto found, as I shall very speedily freely manifest to the world. The way of flying in the Air seems principally unpracticable, by reason of the want of strength in humane muscles; if therefore that could be suppli’d, it were, I think, easie to make twenty contrivances to perform the office of Wings: What Attempts also I have made for the supplying that Defect, and my successes therein, which, I think, are wholly new, and not inconsiderable, I shall in another place relate.  ’Tis not unlikely also, but that Chymists, if they followed this method, might find out their so much sought for Alkahest. What an universal Menstruum, which dissolves all sorts of Sulphureous Bodies, I have discover’d (which has not been before taken notice of as such) I have shewn in the sixteenth Observation.  What a prodigious variety of Inventions in Anatomy has this latter Age afforded, even in our own Bodies in the very Heart, by which we live, and the Brain, which is the seat of our knowledge of other things? witness all the excellent Works of Pecquet, Bartholinus, Billius, and many others; and at home, of Doctor Harvy, Doctor Ent, Doctor Willis, Doctor Glisson. In Celestial Observations we have far exceeded all the Antients, even the Chaldeans and Egyptians themselves, whose vast Plains, high Towers, and clear Air, did not give them so great advantages over us, as have over them by our Glasses. By the help of which, they have been very much outdone by the famous Galileo, Hevelius, Zulichem; and our own Countrymen, Mr. Rook, Doctor Wren, and the great Ornament of our Church and Nation, the Lord Bishop of Exeter. And to say no more in Aerial Discoveries, there has been a wonderful progress made by the Noble Engine of the most Illustrious Mr. Boyle, whom it becomes me to mention with all honour, not only as my particular Patron, but as the Patron of Philosophy it self; which he every day increases by his Labours, and adorns by his Example.		
A2275	And I do not only propose this kind of Experimental Philosophy as a matter of high rapture and delight of the mind, but even as a material and sensible Pleasure		
A2276	Experimental Philosophy		
A2277	the greatness of your Mercy		
A2278	The good success of all these great Men, and many others, and the now seemingly great obviousness of most of their and divers other Inventions,		
A2279	puts me in mind to recommend such Studies		
A2280	the prosecution of them by such methods		
A2281	So vast it the variety of Objects which will come under their Inspections, so many different wayes there are of handling them, so great is the satisfaction of finding out new things, that I dare compare the contentment which they will injoy, not only to that of contemplation, but even to that which most men prefer of the very Senses themselves		
A2282	there has not been any inquiry or Problem in Mechanicks, that I have hitherto propounded to my self, but by a certain method (which I may on some other opportunity explain) I have been able presently to examine the possibility of it; and if so, as easily to excogitate divers wayes of performing it: And indeed it is possible to do as much by this method in Mechanicks, as by Algebra can be perform’d in Geometry. Nor can I at all doubt, but that the same method is as applicable to Physical Enquiries, and as likely to find and reap thence as plentiful a crop of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren, but may with this good husbandry be highly improv’d		
A2283	it is possible to do as much by this method in Mechanicks, as by Algebra can be perform’d in Geometry. Nor can I at all doubt, but that the same method is as applicable to Physical Enquiries, and as likely to find and reap thence as plentiful a crop of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren, but may with this good husbandry be highly improv’d		
A2284	Toward the prosecution of this method in Physical Inquiries, I have here and there gleaned up an handful of Observations, in the collection of most of which I made use of Microscopes, and some other Glasses and Instruments that improve the sense		
A2285	I made use of Microscopes, and some other Glasses and Instruments that improve the sense		
A2286	to promote the use of Mechanical helps for the Senses, both in the surveying the already visible World, and for the discovery of many others hitherto unknown		
A2287	to make us, with the great Conqueror, to be affected that we have not yet overcome one World when there are so many others to be discovered, every considerable improvement of Telescopes or Microscopes producing new Worlds and Terra-Incognita’s to our view		
A2288	The Glasses I used were of our English make, but though very good of the kind, yet far short of what might be expected, could we once find a way of making Glasses Elliptical, or of some more true shape; for though both Microscopes, and Telescopes, as they now are, will magnifie an Object about a thousand thousand times bigger then it appears to the naked eye; yet the Apertures of the Object-glasses are so very small, that very few Rays are admitted, and even of those few there are so many false, that the Object appears dark and indistinct: And indeed these inconveniences are such, as seem inseparable from Spherical Glasses, even when most exactly made; but the way we have hitherto made use of for that purpose is so imperfect, that there may be perhaps ten wrought before one be made tolerably good, and most of those ten perhaps every one differing in goodness one from another, which is an Argument, that the way hitherto used is, at least, very uncertain. So that these Glasses have a double defect; the one, that very few of them are exactly true wrought; the other, that even of those that are best among them, none will admit a sufficient number of Rayes to magnifie the Object beyond a determinate bigness. Against which Inconveniences the only Remedies I have hitherto met with are these		
A2289	for Microscopes (where the Object we view is near and within our power) the best way of making it appear bright in the Glass, is to cast a great quantity of light on it by means of convex glasses, for thereby, though the aperture be very small, yet there will throng in through it such multitudes, that an Object will by this means indure to be magnifi’d as much again as it would be without it		
A2290	As for Telescopes, the only improvement they seem capable of, is the increasing of their length		
A2291	I have experimentally observ’d in one of that length made by Mr. Richard Reives here at London		
A2292	And for performing both these, I cannot imagine any way more easie, and more exact, then by this following Engine, by means of which, any Glasses, of what length soever, may be speedily made. It seems the most easie, because with one and the same Tool may be with care ground an Object Glass, of any length or breadth requisite, and that with very little or no trouble in fitting the Engine, and without much skill in the Grinder. It seems to be the most exact, for to the very last stroke the Glass does regulate and rectifie the Tool to its exact Figure; and the longer or more the Tool and Glass are wrought together, the more exact will both of them be of the desir’d Figure. Further, the motions of the Glass and Tool do so cross each other, that there is not one point of eithers Surface, but has thousands of cross motions thwarting it, so that there can be no kind of Rings or Gutters made either in the Tool or Glass		
A2293	supposing the Mandrils well made, and of a good length, and supposing great care be used in working and polishing them, I see no reason, but that a Glass of a thousand, nay of ten thousand foot long, may be as well made as one of ten		
A2294	we are certain, from the Laws of refraction (which I I have experimentally found to be so, by an Instrument I shall presently describe) that the lines of the angles of Incidence are proportionate to the lines of the angles of Refraction		
A2295	we are certain, from the Laws of refraction		
A2296	I have experimentally found to be so, by an Instrument I shall presently describe		
A2297	I have experimentally found to be so		
A2298	if Glasses could be made of those kind of Figures, or some other, such as the most incomparable Des Cartes has invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works, we might hope for a much greater perfection of Opticks then can be rationally expected from spherical ones		
A2299	as the most incomparable Des Cartes has invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works		
A2300	Des Cartes has invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works		
A2301	though I know two or three wayes, which, as far as I have yet considered, seem very probable, and may invite me to make a tryal as soon as I have an opportunity, of which I may hereafter perhaps acquaint the world		
A2302	to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals; and to let them see that the laws of Refraction are not only notional		
A2303	to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals		
A2304	By means of this Instrument I can with little trouble, and a very small quantity of any Liquor, examine, most accurately, the refraction of it not only for one inclination, but for all; and thereby am inabled to make very accurate Tables		
A2305	I have also experimentally made, and find, that Oyl of Turpentine has a much greater Refraction then Spirit of Wine, though it be lighter; and that Spirit of Wine has a greater Refraction then Water, though it be lighter also; but that salt Water also has a greater Refraction then fresh, though it be heavier: but Alum water has a less refraction then common Water, though heavier also. So that it seems, as to the refraction made in a Liquor, the specifick gravity is of no efficacy. By this I have also found that look what proportion the Sine of the Angle of one Inclination has to the Sine of the Angle of Refraction, correspondent to it, the same proportion have all the Sines of other Inclinations to the Sines of their appropriate Refractions.		
A2306	Now though this were the Instrument I made most use of, yet I have made several other Tryals with other kinds of Microscopes, which both for matter and form were very different from common spherical Glasses. I have made a Microscope with one piece of Glass, both whose surfaces were plains. I have made another only with a plano concave, without any kind of reflection, divers also by means of reflection. I have made others of Waters, Gums, Resins, Salts, Arsenick, Oyls, and with divers other mixtures of watery and oyly Liquors. And indeed the subject is capable of a great variety; but I find generally none more useful then that which is made with two Glasses, such as I have already describ’d.		
A2307	I indeavoured (as far as I was able) first to discover the true appearance, and next to make a plain representation of it. This I mention the rather, because of these kind of Objects there is much more difficulty to discover the true shape, then of those visible to the naked eye, the same Object seeming quite differing, in one position to the Light, from what it really is, and may be discover’d in another. And therefore I never began to make any draught before by many examinations in several lights, and in several positions to those lights, I had discover’d the true form. For it is exceeding difficult in some Objects, to distinguish between a prominency and a depression, between a shadow and a black stain, or a reflection and a whiteness in the colour. Besides, the transparency of most Objects renders them yet much more difficult then if they were opacous.		
A2308	this was undertaken in prosecution of the Design which the ROYAL SOCIETY has propos’d to it self. For the Members of the Assembly having before their eys so many fatal Instances of the errors and falshoods, in which the greatest part of mankind has so long wandred, because they rely’d upon the strength of humane Reason alone, have begun anew to correct all Hypotheses by sense, as Seamen do their dead Reckonings by Cœlestial Observations; and to this purpose it has been their principal indeavour to enlarge & strengthen the Senses by Medicine, and by such outward Instruments as are proper for their particular works		
A2309	in prosecution of the Design which the ROYAL SOCIETY has propos’d to it self		
A2310	they find some reason to suspect, that those effects of Bodies, which have been commonly attributed to Qualities, and those confess’d to be occult, are perform’d by the small Machines of Nature, which are not to be discern’d without these helps, seeming the meer products of Motion, Figure, and Magnitude		
A2311	which are not to be discern’d without these helps		
A2312	the Natural Textures, which some call the Plastick faculty, may be made in Looms, which a greater perfection of Opticks may make discernable by these Glasses		
A2313	And the ends of all these Inquiries they intend to be the Pleasure of Contemplative minds, but above all, the ease and dispatch of the labours of mens hands. They do indeed neglect no opportunity to bring all the rare things of Remote Countries within the compass of their knowledge and practice		
A2314	They do not wholly reject Experiments of meer light and theory; but they principally aim at such, whose Applications will improve and facilitate the present way of Manual Arts. And though some men, who are perhaps taken up about less honourable Employments, are pleas’d to censure their proceedings, yet they can shew more fruits of their first three years, wherein they have assembled, then any other Society in Europe can for a much larger space of time. ’Tis true, such undertakings as theirs do commonly meet with small incouragement, because men are generally rather taken with the plausible and discursive, then the real and the solid part of Philosophy; yet by the good fortune of their institution, in an Age of all others the most inquisitive, they have been assisted by the contribution and presence of very many of the chief Nobility and Gentry, and others who are some of the most considerable in their several Professions. But that that yet farther convinces me of the Real esteem that the more serious part of men have of this Society, is, that several Merchants, men who act in earnest (whose Object is meum & tuum, that great Rudder of humane affairs) have adventur’d considerable sums of Money, to put in practice what some of our Members have contrived, and have continued stedfast in their good opinions of such Indeavours, when not one of a hundred of the vulgar have believed their undertakings feasable. And it is also fit to be added, that they have one advantage peculiar to themselves, that very many of their number are men of Converse and Traffick; which is a good Omen, that their attempts will bring Philosophy from words to action, seeing the men of Business have had so great a share in their first foundation.		
A2315	And of this kind I ought not to conceal one particular Generosity, which more nearly concerns my self. It is the munificence of Sir John Cutler		
A2316	endowing a Lecture for the promotion of Mechanick Arts, to be governed and directed by This Society.This Bounty I mention for the Honourableness of the thing it self, and for the expectation which I have of the efficacy of the Example		
A2317	This Gentleman has well observ’d, that the Arts of life have been too long imprison’d in the dark shops of Mechanicks themselves, & there hindred from growth, either by ignorance, or self-interest: and he has bravely freed them from these inconveniences: He hath not only obliged Tradesmen, but Trade it self: He has done a work that is worthy of London, and has taught the chief City of Commerce in the world the right way how Commerce is to be improv’d		
A2318	For by his diligence about the Corporation for the Poor; by his honorable Subscriptions for the rebuilding of St. Paul’s; by his chearful Disbursment for the replanting of Ireland, and by many other such publick works, he has shewn by what means he indeavours to establish his Memory; and now by this last gift he has done that, which became one of the wisest Citizens of our Nation to accomplish, seeing one of the wisest of our Statesmen, the Lord Verulam, first propounded it		
A2319	If these my first Labours shall be any wayes useful to inquiring men, I must attribute the incouragement and promotion of them to a very Reverend and Learned Person, of whom this ought in justice to be said, That there is scarce any one Invention, which this Nation has produc’d in our Age, but it has some way or other been set forward by his assistance		
A2320	I must attribute the incouragement and promotion of them to a very Reverend and Learned Person		
A2321	In the sweetness of whose behaviour, in the calmness of his mind, in the unbounded goodness of his heart, we have an evident Instance, what the true and the primitive unpassionate Religion was, before it was sowred by particular Factions		
A2322	I thank God, that Dr. Wilkins was an Englishman, for whereever he had lived, there had been the chief Seat of generous Knowledge and true Philosophy		
A2323	By the Advice of this Excellent man I first set upon this Enterprise, yet still came to it with much Reluctancy, because I was to follow the footsteps of so eminent a Person as Dr. Wren, who was the first that attempted any thing of this nature; whose original draughts do now make one of the Ornaments of that great Collection of Rarities in the Kings Closet. This Honor, which his first beginnings of this kind have receiv’d, to be admitted into the most famous place of the world, did not so much incourage, as the hazard of coming after Dr. Wren did affright me; for of him I must affirm, that, since the time of Archimedes, there scarce ever met in one man, in so great a perfection, such a Mechanical Hand, and so Philosophical a Mind.  But at last, being assured both by Dr. Wilkins, and Dr. Wren himself, that he had given over his intentions of prosecuting it, and not finding that there was any else design’d the pursuing of it, I set upon this undertaking, and was not a little incourag’d to proceed in it, by the Honour the Royal Society was pleas’d to favour me with, in approving of those draughts (which from time to time as I had an opportunity of describing) I presented to them. And particularly by the Incitements of divers of those Noble and excellent Persons of it, which were my more especial Friends, who were not less urgent with me for the publishing, then for the prosecution of them.  After I had almost compleated these Pictures and Observations (having had divers of them engraven, and was ready to send them to the Press) I was inform’d, that the Ingenious Physitian Dr. Henry Power had made several Microscopical Observations, which had I not afterwards, upon our interchangably viewing each others Papers, found that they were for the most part differing from mine, either in the Subject it self, or in the particulars taken notice of; and that his design was only to print Observations without Pictures, I had even then suppressed what I had so far proceeded in. But being further excited by several of my Friends, in compliance with their opinions, that it would not be unacceptable to several inquisitive Men, and hoping also, that I should thereby discover something New to the World, I have at length cast in my Mite, into the vast Treasury of A Philosophical History. And it is my hope, as well as belief, that these my Labours will be no more comparable to the Productions of many other Natural Philosophers, who are now every where busie about greater things; then my little Objects are to be compar’d to the greater and more beautiful Works of Nature, A Flea, a Mite, a Gnat, to an Horse, an Elephant, or a Lyon.		
A2324	you can forgive the most presumptuous Offendors		
A2325	Amidst the many felicities that have accompani’d your Majesties happy Restauration and Government, it is none of the least considerable that Philosophy and Experimental Learning have prosper’d under your Royal Patronage		
A2326	so it is just, that the Fruits of them should, by way of acknowledgement, be return’d to your Majesty		
A2327	The Rules YOU have prescrib’d YOUR selves in YOUR Philosophical Progress do seem the best that have ever yet been practis’d. And particularly that of avoiding Dogmatizing, and the espousal of any Hypothesis not sufficiently grounded and confirm’d by Experiments. This way seems the most excellent, and may preserve both Philosophy and Natural History from its former Corruptions		
A2328	By the addition of such artificial Instruments and methods, there may be, in some manner, a reparation made for the mischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self, by negligence, and intemperance, and a wilful and superstitious deserting the Prescripts and Rules of Nature, whereby every man, both from a deriv’d corruption, innate and born with him, and from his breeding and converse with men, is very subject to slip into all sorts of errors.		
A2329	we cannot but observe them to be in many particulars much outdone by those of other Creatures		
A2330	all the other degrees of Reason, are lyable to the same imperfection		
A2331	So that the errors of the understanding are answerable to the two other, being defective both in the quantity and goodness of its knowledge		
A2332	And from thence it must follow, that not having a full sensation of the Object, we must be very lame and imperfect in our conceptions about it, and in all the proportions which we build upon it; hence, we often take the shadow of things for the substance, small appearances for good similitudes, similitudes for definitions; and even many of those, which we think, to be the most solid definitions, are rather expressions of our own misguided apprehensions then of the true nature of the things themselves.		
A2333	experimental Philosophy		
A2334	These being the dangers in the process of humane Reason, the remedies of them all can only proceed from the real, the mechanical, the experimental Philosophy

A2342	By this the Earth it self, which lyes so neer us, under our feet, shews quite a new thing to us, and in every little particle of its matter; we now behold almost as great a variety of Creatures, as we were able before to reckon up in the whole Universe it self.

A2345	The truth is, the Science of Nature has been already too long made only a work of the Brain and the Fancy: It is now high time that it should return to the plainness and soundness of Observations on material and obvious things		
A2346	I have produced nothing here, with intent to bind his understanding to an implicit consent; I am so far from that, that I desire him, not absolutely to rely upon these Observations of my eyes, if he finds them contradicted by the future Ocular Experiments of sober and impartial Discoverers.

A2350	and all my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me;		
A2351	I may prepare and furnish them with some Materials, which they may afterwards order and manage with better skill, and to far greater advantage.		
A2352	far greater advantage.		
A2353	Reason of Man		
A2354	seeking to inlarge our Knowledge		
A2355	The Understanding is to order all the inferiour services of the lower Faculties; but yet it is to do this only as a lawful Master, and not as a Tyrant		
A2356	as a lawful Master, and not as a Tyrant		
A2357	Reason		
A2358	it is to begin with the Hands and Eyes, and to proceed on through the Memory, to be continued by the Reason; nor is it to stop there, but to come about to the Hands and Eyes again, and so, by a continual passage round from one Faculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength		
A2359	we might not only hope for Inventions to equalize those of Copernicus, Galileo, Gilbert, Harvy, and of others, whose Names are almost lost, that were the Inventors of Gun-powder, the Seamans Compass, Printing, Etching, Graving, Microscopes, &c. but multitudes that may far exceed them		
A2360	And as at first, mankind fell by tasting of the forbidden Tree of Knowledge, so we, their Posterity, may be in part restor’d by the same way, not only by beholding and contemplating, but by tasting too those fruits of Natural knowledge, that were never yet forbidden.		
A2361	From hence the World may be assisted with variety of Inventions, new matter for Sciences may be collected, the old improv’d, and their rust rubb’d away;		
A2362	as Glasses have highly promoted our seeing, so ’tis not improbable, but that there may be found many Mechanical Inventions to improve our other Senses, of hearing, smelling, tasting, touching		
A2363	Several tryals I have made, both of hindring and promoting this sense, and have succeeded in some according to expectation		
A2364	an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the Air		
A2365	I fear, many times not so truly, they seeming, several of them, to be design’d more for Ostentation then publique use		
A2366	What a prodigious variety of Inventions in Anatomy has this latter Age afforded, even in our own Bodies in the very Heart, by which we live, and the Brain, which is the seat of our knowledge of other things?		
A2367	n Celestial Observations we have far exceeded all the Antients, even the Chaldeans and Egyptians themselves, whose vast Plains, high Towers, and clear Air, did not give them so great advantages over us, as have over them by our Glasses. By the help of which, they have been very much outdone by the famous Galileo, Hevelius, Zulichem; and our own Countrymen, Mr. Rook, Doctor Wren, and the great Ornament of our Church and Nation, the Lord Bishop of Exeter.		
A2368	there has been a wonderful progress made by the Noble Engine of the most Illustrious Mr. Boyle, whom it becomes me to mention with all honour, not only as my particular Patron, but as the Patron of Philosophy it self; which he every day increases by his Labours, and adorns by his Example.		
A2369	puts me in mind to recommend such Studies,		
A2370	not only to that of contemplation, but even to that which most men prefer of the very Senses themselves.		
A2371	to promote the use of Mechanical helps for the Senses, both in the surveying the already visible World, and for the discovery of many others hitherto unknown, and to make us, with the great Conqueror, to be affected that we have not yet overcome one World when there are so many others to be discovered		
A2372	as I have experimentally observ’d in one of that length made by Mr. Richard Reives here at London		
A2373	the Laws of refraction (which I I have experimentally found to be so, by an Instrument I shall presently describe		
A2374	has invented, and demonstrated		
A2375	thereby to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals		
A2376	to let them see that the laws of Refraction are not only notional		
A2377	thereby am inabled to make very accurate Tables; several of which I have also experimentally made		
A2378	For placing the Object, I made this contrivance;		
A2379	by means of which contrivance I could place and fix the Tube in what posture I desir’d (which for many Observations was exceeding necessary) and adjusten it most exactly to any Object		
A2380	whose Applications will improve and facilitate the present way of Manual Arts.		
A2381	they can shew more fruits of their first three years, wherein they have assembled, then any other Society in Europe can for a much larger space of time

A2383	hat several Merchants, men who act in earnest (whose Object is meum & tuum, that great Rudder of humane affairs) have adventur’d considerable sums of Money, to put in practice what some of our Members have contrived, and have continued stedfast in their good opinions of such Indeavours, when not one of a hundred of the vulgar have believed their undertakings feasable.

A2391	The servants who had discovered where Cinderella lived were promoted to the highest positions in the palace as a reward.		
A2392	"""Since I am about making a journey, what do you want me to bring you when I return?"""		
A2393	"They called her Cinderella because she always sat in the chimney-corner.  ""You must buy me a little bird Verdeliò."""		
A2394	"They called her Cinderella because she always sat in the chimney-corner.  ""You must buy me a little bird Verdeliò.""  ""The simpleton! she does not know what to do with the bird! Instead of ordering a handsome dress, a fine shawl, she takes a bird."		
A2395	The father went, and on his return brought the dress, hat, and shawl for the two sisters, and the little bird for Cinderella.		
A2396	"""I am going to give three balls; if you want to bring your daughters, do so; they will amuse themselves a little.""  ""As you wish,"" he replies, ""thanks!"" and accepts."		
A2397	"""There, you see, Cinderella, if you had only asked for a handsome dress! This evening we are going to the ball.""  She replied: ""It matters nothing to me! You go; I am not coming."""		
A2398	"they adorned themselves, saying to Cinderella: ""Come along, there will be room for you, too."""		
A2399	"In the evening, when the time came, they adorned themselves, saying to Cinderella: ""Come along, there will be room for you, too.""  ""I don't want to go; you go; I don't want to."""		
A2400	"The bird made ready two purses of money, and said to her: ""Take these two purses, enter your carriage, and away!"""		
A2401	"""Keep it for yourself,"" she said."		
A2402	She perceives that she is followed, takes the money and begins to throw it out of the window of the carriage. The greedy servants, I tell you, seeing all that money, thought no more of her, but stopped to pick up the money.		
A2403	"When the sisters returned, they cried: ""Cin-der-ella!""  ""Oh, leave her alone,"" said her father; ""she is asleep now, leave her alone!"""		
A2404	"""Do you see, you simpleton? You might have had it.""  ""It matters nothing to me."""		
A2405	"""Wretches, you are nothing else,"" he said, ""were you afraid of not being rewarded? Well! to-morrow evening, attention, under pain of death."""		
A2406	"She threw out so much money!"""		
A2407	"""Thus and thus! She threw out so much money!""  ""Wretches, you are nothing else,"" he said, ""were you afraid of not being rewarded? Well! to-morrow evening, attention, under pain of death."""		
A2408	"""Will you come this evening, Cinderella?"""		
A2409	"The sisters say:  ""Will you come this evening, Cinderella?""  ""Oh,"" she says, ""don't bother me! I don't want to go."""		
A2410	"She replied: ""Keep it for yourself."""		
A2411	"""If Cinderella were here, who knows what might not happen to her! To-morrow she must come!"""		
A2412	"""Cin-der-ella! if you only knew what that lady gave us!""  ""It matters nothing to me!"""

A2416	"""Keep it for yourself!"""		
A2417	"""Signora, you have dropped this snuff-box."""		
A2418	she placed herself by her father's side, drew out her handkerchief, and there fell out a snuff-box of gold, full of money.		
A2419	"""Signora, you have dropped this."""		
A2420	he opens it and sees it full of money

A2425	"""See what a beautiful snuff-box. If you had gone you might have had it.""  ""I do not care! Go away!"""		
A2426	Then their father called them to supper.		
A2427	Take care to tell the truth! because his Majesty wishes it, under pain of death!		
A2428	"""You must come down! there are some gentlemen here who wish to see you.""  ""I don't want to come."""		
A2429	"""How many daughters have you?""  ""Two."" ""Well, show them to us.""  The father made them come in there.  ""Sit down,"" they said to one of them. They tried the slipper on her; it was ten times too large for her.  The other one sat down; it was too small for her.  ""But tell me, good man, have you no other daughters? Take care to tell the truth! because his Majesty wishes it, under pain of death!""  ""Gentlemen, there is another one, but I do not mention it. She is all in the ashes, the coals; if you should see her! I do not call her my daughter from shame."""		
A2430	"The bird said: ""Take me away with you! Put me in your bosom!""  She puts the bird in her bosom and begins to descend the stairs."		
A2431	"""do you hear her? She is dragging with her the chains from the chimney-corner. You can imagine how frightful she will look!""  When she reached the last step, and they saw her, ""Ah!"" they exclaimed, and recognized the lady of the ball."		
A2432	They made her sit down, and tried on the slipper, and it fitted her.		
A2433	She sends for her father and sisters, and makes them all come to the palace.		
A2434	"""Since I am about making a journey, what do you want me to bring you when I return?"		
A2435	"""The simpleton! she does not know what to do with the bird! Instead of ordering a handsome dress, a fine shawl, she takes a bird."		
A2436	"""Silence!"" she says, ""it pleases me."""		
A2437	"""I am going to give three balls; if you want to bring your daughters, do so; they will amuse themselves a little."""

A2440	"""Come along, there will be room for you, too."""		
A2441	"""I don't want to go; you go; I don't want to."""

A2449	How troublesome you are! Let her alone!		
A2450	"""Keep it for yourself."""		
A2451	"""If Cinderella were here, who knows what might not happen to her! To-morrow she must come!"		
A2452	She began to throw out all the sand, and they were blinded		
A2453	"""It matters nothing to me!"""		
A2454	"""Oh let her alone! you are always teasing her!"""

A2456	He had already given orders to his servants to be on the lookout, under pain of death

A2462	"make me more beautiful than I am!"""		
A2463	all in love as he was, he said to her:		
A2464	loved		
A2465	He therefore left hell, took the form of a handsome young man, and built a fine large house		
A2466	When it was completed and furnished in the most fashionable style he introduced himself to a family where there were three pretty daughters		
A2467	The handsome man pleased the maiden		
A2468	her parents were glad to see a daughter so well provided for		
A2469	"""The whole house is at your disposal,"" said he, ""only I must request one thing of you; that is, that you do not on any account open this door."""		
A2470	Of course the young wife promised faithfully; but equally, of course, she could scarcely wait for the moment to come when she might break her promise.		
A2471	a terrible abyss full of fire that shot up towards her, and singed the flowers on her bosom		
A2472	"When her husband came home and asked her whether she had kept her promise, she unhesitatingly said ""Yes."" But he saw by the flowers that she was telling a lie"		
A2473	she could scarcely wait for the moment to come when she might break her promise		
A2474	curiosity		
A2475	"""Now I will not put your curiosity to the test any longer. Come with me. I will show you myself what is behind the door."" Thereupon he led her to the door, opened it, gave her such a push that she fell down into hell"		
A2476	She was a prudent maiden		
A2477	"""He has certainly murdered my two sisters; but then it is a splendid match for me, so I will try and see whether I cannot be more fortunate than they."""		
A2478	accordingly she consented		
A2479	Not a whit less curious than her sisters, she, too, opened the forbidden door when the devil had gone hunting		
A2480	she had previously put her flowers in water		
A2481	I thought I had married an ordinary man, and instead of that he is the devil!		
A2482	"I thought I had married an ordinary man, and instead of that he is the devil! How can I get away from him?"""		
A2483	She carefully pulled her two sisters out of hell and hid them.		
A2484	he now, for the first time, really loved her.		
A2485	she asked him if he would carry three chests for her to her parents' house, without putting them down or resting on the way.		
A2486	"""you must keep your word, for I shall be watching you."""		
A2487	The devil promised to do exactly as she wished.		
A2488	she put one of her sisters in a chest, and laid it on her husband's shoulders.		
A2489	She therefore prepared a figure which she dressed in her own clothes, and placed on the balcony, under the pretext of being able to watch him better		
A2490	"""If you do not come down instantly I will go up and bring you down,"" he cried, angrily; but Margerita did not stir."		
A2491	he hastened up to the balcony, and gave her such a box on the ear that her head flew off, and he saw that the head was nothing but a milliner's form, and the body, a bundle of rags		
A2492	Three wives at once terrified the devil so much that he took his flight with all possible speed.		
A2493	time the devil was seized with a desire to marry		
A2494	"""The whole house is at your disposal,"""

A2501	", ""He has certainly murdered my two sisters; but then it is a splendid match for me, so I will try and see whether I cannot be more fortunate than they."""		
A2502	Not a whit less curious than her sisters, she, too, opened the forbidden door when the devil had gone hunting, but she had previously put her flowers in water		
A2503	"""poor creature that I am; I thought I had married an ordinary man, and instead of that he is the devil!"		
A2504	She carefully pulled her two sisters out of hell and hid them		
A2505	The devil promised to do exactly as she wished		
A2506	So the next morning she put one of her sisters in a chest, and laid it on her husband's shoulders		
A2507	"""She cannot see me here; I will rest a little."" But scarcely had he begun to put the chest down when the sister inside cried out, ""Don't put it down; I see you still!"""		
A2508	She therefore prepared a figure which she dressed in her own clothes, and placed on the balcony, under the pretext of being able to watch him better; slipped quickly into the chest, and had the maid put it on the devil's back		
A2509	and gave her such a box on the ear that her head flew off, and he saw that the head was nothing but a milliner's form, and the body, a bundle of rags.

A2511	there was a man whose wife died		
A2512	"""Give your father my kindest greetings."""		
A2513	"Because of these friendly greetings the man thought, ""She would be a wife for me,"" and he married the woman."		
A2514	"""I cannot kill my child!"""		
A2515	"Then she said to her husband, ""The girl eats too much of our bread. We will have to get rid of her."" But the man said, ""I cannot kill my child!"""		
A2516	"the woman said, ""Tomorrow take her with you out into the country and leave her there alone, so that she will not be able to find her way back home."" The next day the man called his daughter and said to her, ""We are going out into the country. We will take something to eat with us."""		
A2517	"Then she said to her husband, ""The girl eats too much of our bread. We will have to get rid of her."" But the man said, ""I cannot kill my child!"" Then the woman said, ""Tomorrow take her with you out into the country and leave her there alone, so that she will not be able to find her way back home."" The next day the man called his daughter and said to her, ""We are going out into the country. We will take something to eat with us."""		
A2518	Maria was clever, and she filled her pockets with bran		
A2519	As she walked along behind her father, from time to time she threw down a little pile of bran onto the pathway		
A2520	"Her father dropped the loaf of bread over the cliff, then cried out, ""Oh, Maria, our bread fell down there!"""		
A2521	"""Father,"" said Maria, ""I will climb down and get it."""		
A2522	Following the bran, she finally arrived home again, late that night.		
A2523	"""Oh, father,"" she said, ""why did you leave me alone?"" The man comforted her and talked to her until he had reassured her."		
A2524	some time later she again told her husband that he should take Maria out into the country and abandon her in the woods. The next morning the man called his daughter once again, and they set forth.		
A2525	The father again dropped the bread over the edge, and Maria had to climb down to get it. When she arrived back at the top, her father had gone away, and she was alone		
A2526	Evening came, and suddenly she saw a light.		
A2527	The next morning they left, but the youngest brother remained at home in order to cook the food and clean the house		
A2528	After they had left, the youngest brother went out to buy food.		
A2529	Maria came out from behind the dough trough, swept and cleaned the house, and then put the kettle on the fire in order to cook the beans.		
A2530	He pretended that he too was going away, but he returned at once and saw Maria, who had come out once again to clean up the house.		
A2531	"""Oh,"" she begged, "" for heaven's sake, do not kill me!"" ""Who are you?"" asked the robber. Then she told him about her wicked stepmother, and how her father had abandoned her in the woods, and how for two days she had been hiding behind the dough trough. ""You don't have to be afraid of us,"" said the robber."		
A2532	"""Oh,"" she begged, "" for heaven's sake, do not kill me!"" ""Who are you?"" asked the robber. Then she told him about her wicked stepmother, and how her father had abandoned her in the woods, and how for two days she had been hiding behind the dough trough. ""You don't have to be afraid of us,"" said the robber. ""Stay here with us and be our sister, and cook, sew, and wash for us."""		
A2533	When the other brothers returned home, they were satisfied with this, so Maria stayed with the seven robbers, did their housekeeping, and was always quiet and diligent.		
A2534	"""I don't have much, for I myself am a poor, unhappy girl, but I will give you what I have."""		
A2535	Maria told her how she had left home and had come here. The poor woman went forth and told the wicked stepmother that Maria was still alive.		
A2536	"when Maria gave her something, she said, ""Look, my child, I have here a beautiful ring. Because you have been so good to me, I want to give it to you."""		
A2537	Suspecting nothing, Maria took the ring, but when she put it on her finger she fell down dead.		
A2538	When the robbers returned home and found Maria on the floor, they were very sad, and they cried bitterly for her.		
A2539	they made a beautiful coffin and laid Maria inside it, after having adorned her with the most beautiful jewelry.		
A2540	When they came to the king's castle they saw that the stall door was wide open. They drove the oxen inside, in order to bring the cart into the stall.		
A2541	Hearing the noise, the king sent someone down to ask the stall-master what had happened		
A2542	He had four large wax candles brought and had them placed at the four corners of the coffin and lit.		
A2543	When it was time to eat, his mother sent for him, asking him to come		
A2544	When it was time to eat, his mother sent for him, asking him to come. He did not answer at once, but instead wept all the more fervently		
A2545	when she saw that her son was kneeling next to a corpse, she had the door broken down		
A2546	when she saw that her son was kneeling next to a corpse, she had the door broken down. However, when she saw the beautiful girl, she herself was very moved, and she leaned over Maria and took her hand.		
A2547	Then all at once the dead Maria came to life again.		
A2548	"The young king said joyfully to his mother, ""This girl shall be my wife!"" The old queen answered, ""Yes, so shall it be!"" and she embraced Maria."		
A2549	They lived joyfully and in splendor until they died.		
A2550	"The young king said joyfully to his mother, ""This girl shall be my wife!"" The old queen answered, ""Yes, so shall it be!"" and she embraced Maria. Thus Maria became the king's wife, and the queen"		
A2551	"The young king said joyfully to his mother, ""This girl shall be my wife!"" The old queen answered, ""Yes, so shall it be!"" and she embraced Maria. Thus Maria became the king's wife, and the queen."		
A2552	"Because of these friendly greetings the man thought, ""She would be a wife for me,"""		
A2553	"The father said, ""Eh! my daughter, if I take another wife, you will have great troubles."""		
A2554	When she saw him she was well pleased, and they settled the marriage in a few days.		
A2555	"""Ask your father if he would like me for a wife."" This she said to her every day, and at last the girl said, ""Papa, the school-mistress is always asking me if you will marry her."""		
A2556	But the girl persisted, and finally the father was persuaded to go one evening to the school-mistress' house.		
A2557	they remained peaceful and contended.		
A2558	"Eh!"" she replied, ""perhaps she fell from this terrace and went into the river; I have not heard from her in ten days."" The eagle answered, ""What a fool you are! I carried her away; seeing that you treated her so harshly I carried her away to my fairies, and she is very well."""		
A2559	"""You see my daughter is alive, and is in the house of some fairies of an eagle which often comes upon my terrace; now you must do me the favor to find some way to kill this stepdaughter of mine, for I am afraid that some day or other she will return, and my husband, discovering this matter, will certainly kill me."""		
A2560	the letter pretended that her father was so glad to hear that she was with the fairies.		
A2561	"""Do not be anxious, I am well off, and my stepmother has nothing to do with me."" But it was not so"		
A2562	But meanwhile the blows redoubled, and curiosity forced her to look out of the window		
A2563	She saw one the servant girls of her own home (for the witch had disguised herself as one of her father's servants).		
A2564	"When the witch had given her the basket, she said, ""Eat this,"" and broke off for her a piece of the sweetmeats which she had poisoned. When Ermellina took the first mouthful the old woman disappeared"		
A2565	Ermellina said they need not worry, that she would not open to anyone. But it was not so		
A2566	The stepmother denied it all to the eagle, but she summoned anew the witch		
A2567	"""Either you will really kill her, or I will be avenged on you."""		
A2568	"She replied, ""No, no; for I have been deceived once."" ""But I am not the old woman,"" replied the tailoress, ""you know me, for I have always made your dresses."""		
A2569	"""But I am not the old woman,"" replied the tailoress, ""you know me, for I have always made your dresses."" Poor Ermellina was persuaded, and descended the stairs"		
A2570	the chief struck her enchanted wand, and commanded a beautiful rich casket all covered with diamonds and other precious stones to appear; then the others made a beautiful garland of flowers and gold, put it on the young girl, and then laid her in the casket, which was so rich and beautiful that it was marvelous to behold		
A2571	His mother began to laugh, and withdrew to her own room (what could she do, poor mother?).		
A2572	"He called his mother, and said, ""Mother, I wish two careful chambermaids, whose business it shall be to guard this casket; for if on my return I find that anything has happened to my casket, I shall have the chambermaids killed."""		
A2573	"His mother, who loved him, said, ""Go, my son, fear nothing, for I myself will watch over your casket."""		
A2574	the king had been victorious, and should return to his palace in a few days		
A2575	He wept several days at being obliged to abandon this treasure of his, but there was no help for it, he had to go. After his departure he did nothing but commend his wife (so he called her) to his mother in his letters. Let us return to the mother, who no longer thought about the matter, not even to have the casket dusted		
A2576	They did so, and the chambermaids went to the room and began to unbutton the dress.

A2579	"The king was on the point of arriving, and his mother said to the doll, ""Come her; put on one of my best dresses."" In short, she arrayed her like a queen"		
A2580	But he took no interest in all this, and ran at once to his room to see the doll; the chambermaids fell on their knees before him saying that the doll smelled so badly that they could not stay in the palace, and were obliged to bury her.		
A2581	reasons		
A2582	there cam forth no longer the doll, but a very beautiful girl, whose like was never seen

A2584	They arranged the wedding, and in a few days were man and wife.		
A2585	"""No, I wish nothing!"" but finally, since women, and especially young girls, are fond of sweetmeats, she descended and opened the door"		
A2586	"""Mother,"" replied her son, ""don't trouble yourself about what it is, it is my wife."""

A2594	The war ended, and the king sorrowfully returned to his castle. His wife's infidelity broke his heart.		
A2595	"""Oh, you wicked man,"" answered the queen, weeping, ""how could you cause your innocent wife to suffer so greatly?"" ""What!"" he cried. ""Did you not write to me that she was guilty of great infidelity."""		
A2596	she provided shelter to travelers		
A2597	The mother could not stand her, precisely because she was so beautiful		
A2598	the maid who brought food to her every day		
A2599	She stepped into the doorway, but when the king walked down the hall she quickly stepped back into the room. However, he saw her, and was completely blinded with her beauty		
A2600	"""Where is the beautiful girl whom I saw in the hallway?"" he asked the maid who was serving him."		
A2601	"""Oh, your majesty,"" she answered, ""that is the innkeeper's daughter, and she is just as good as she is beautiful. But her mother keeps he locked up so that no one can see her."""		
A2602	The king was so enchanted with her beauty that he wanted to marry her		
A2603	"Go to the daughter and ask her if she will be my wife."""		
A2604	"""Just think, miss, the king wants to marry you, and he wants to know if you will flee with him and escape from this house where you are treated so badly."" ""Oh,"" answered the poor girl, ""how would I be able to flee? My mother keeps such a strict watch over me."""		
A2605	Leave here tomorrow, as though you were returning to your home. Stop somewhere nearby. The girl will pretend to be sick, and I'll tell her mother that it is because she is always locked indoors. If she will let her go outside then I'll bring her to you.		
A2606	"Take me with you, because I'll not be able to return without the girl."""		
A2607	The king promised to do this		
A2608	the next day the king pretended to leave. However, he went only a short distance		
A2609	Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me		
A2610	"""Of course the poor child is sick,"" answered the maid. She is always kept inside never gets any fresh air. Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me. Those few steps will bring her back to health."""		
A2611	"""Just what does the girl have that makes her so ill?"" asked the mother. ""Of course the poor child is sick,"" answered the maid. She is always kept inside never gets any fresh air. Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me. Those few steps will bring her back to health."" The mother agreed to this, and the next morning the maid and the daughter left for the fair."		
A2612	He gave the faithful maid so much money that she was able to move to a different country with her entire family.		
A2613	"""This is my dear fiancée,"" he said, ""and now we want to have a splendid wedding."""		
A2614	There was a splendid wedding, and the king and his young wife lived together happily and contentedly. Nearly a year had passed when war broke out, and the king had to go off to battle.		
A2615	"""Mother, dear, I must go away. I entrust my dear wife to you."		
A2616	Not long afterward the young queen gave birth to her first son, and the old queen took good care of her. She immediately wrote a letter to the king telling him of the birth of his son.		
A2617	while he was eating, the innkeeper asked him where he was from and where he was going		
A2618	He explained how he had been sent to report to the king the happy birth of his son. Hearing this, the innkeeper resolved to take revenge against her daughter for having escaped.		
A2619	The messenger lay down and fell asleep, whereupon the innkeeper took the letter from his pocket and replaced it with a different one		
A2620	This letter saddened the king greatly because he was so in love with his wife		
A2621	he wrote to the old queen that she should take good care of his wife and do nothing until he had returned.		
A2622	The innkeeper asked if the king had sent a response with him.		
A2623	The messenger once again fell asleep after eating, and the innkeeper replaced the king's letter with a different one		
A2624	"However, the young queen meekly said, ""I shall do whatever my lord and husband commands!"""		
A2625	"After receiving this letter the old queen cried bitterly, for she dearly loved her daughter-in-law. However, the young queen meekly said, ""I shall do whatever my lord and husband commands!"""		
A2626	She then embraced the old queen and wandered away		
A2627	"As she thus spoke and wept, an old and distinguished man suddenly appeared before her and asked why she was crying. She told him of her sorrow and how she innocently had been inflicted with such severe punishment. ""Don't cry,"" said the old man. ""Come with me, and all will go well with you."" He led her a little further into the woods, then he struck the ground with his staff, and suddenly a castle appeared, much grander than the king's castle."		
A2628	"As she thus spoke and wept, an old and distinguished man suddenly appeared before her and asked why she was crying. She told him of her sorrow and how she innocently had been inflicted with such severe punishment. ""Don't cry,"" said the old man. ""Come with me, and all will go well with you."" He led her a little further into the woods, then he struck the ground with his staff, and suddenly a castle appeared, much grander than the king's castle. A garden was there as well, and the king himself did not have a better one. The old man was Saint Joseph, and he had come to the aid of the innocent young queen."		
A2629	because she was so good, Saint Joseph caused her hands to grow back		
A2630	"""I reported the happy birth of your son, and you replied that I should have her hands chopped off and exiled into the wide world with her child."""		
A2631	"One day the old queen said to him, ""My son, the weather is beautiful, why don't you go hunting? Perhaps it will distract you."""		
A2632	His attendants did not dare to say anything to him		
A2633	Saint Joseph invited them in, fed them, and offered them good beds.		
A2634	Seeing the beautiful child, the king was very moved, but did not know why		
A2635	Saint Joseph invited them in, fed them, and offered them good beds. However, the young queen and her son did not show themselves.		
A2636	He recognized his beloved wife and embraced her and his little son.		
A2637	"""All your sorrows are now at an end. Live happily and contentedly, and if ever you have a wish, just call on me, for I am Saint Joseph."""		
A2638	Then all together they lived happily and contentedly, but we, we went away with nothing.

A2640	you read me Galileo's request in his communication to you, and you added your own exhortation.		
A2641	From this dedication learn my love for proclaiming the truth		
A2642	"WHEN MANY PEOPLE asked my opinion about Galileo's ""Sidereal Messenger,"" I decided to satisfy them all by adopting the short cut of circulating in printed form the letter which I sent to Galileo"		
A2643	Whereas most debaters get all heated up, I regard humor as a more pleasant tone in discussions. Other authors strive for impressiveness in the exposition of philosophy by the weightiness of their assertions; yet they often prove amusing, unintentionally. I seem by nature cut out to lighten the hard work and difficulty of a subject by mental relaxation, conveyed by the style.		
A2644	people in the academic world need not be reminded (let others at least imagine) what it means to defend one's position. When a debater does so, he adopts as his own not only true and traditional views but also absurdities and falsities (in the schools frequently, godless, baneful, and blasphemous beliefs as well). He professes, according to the exigencies of his speech, either that he favors these ideas, or accepts them, upholds them, proves them, or will prove them. Yet at heart he believes nothing less, his motive being merely to give his opponent practice in defending the truth. Hence a disputation becomes more entertaining if an unsophisticated speaker is debarred from the truth as his position by being unexpectedly assigned a contrary thesis, and by being ordered to defend what he never thought would have to be defended.

A2646	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said. I have never belittled or laid false claim to the ideas of others, when I had none of my own. I have never fawned on others, nor have I been self-effacing if I made some better or prior discovery by my own exertions.		
A2647	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said.		
A2648	Yet let no one assume that by my readiness to agree with Galileo I propose to deprive others of their right to disagree with him.		
A2649	I have undertaken herein to defend some of my own views also. I have done so with a conviction of their truth and with serious purpose. Yet I swear to reject them without reservation, as soon as any better informed person points out an error to me by a sound method.		
A2650	I supposed that among others Galileo too, the most highly qualified of all, would discuss with me by mail the new kind of astronomy or celestial physics which I had published, and that he would resume our interrupted correspondence, which had begun twelve years before		
A2651	I swear to reject them without reservation, as soon as any better informed person points out an error to me by a sound method.		
A2652	Instead of reading a book by someone else, he has busied himself with a highly startling revelation (to say nothing about the other subjects in his little book) of four previously unknown planets, discovered by the use of the telescope with two lenses		
A2653	men of the highest reputation, raised by their erudition, seriousness, and steadfastness far above the unreliability of ordinary people, were transmitting these messages about Galileo		
A2654	I was influenced most by Galileo's prestige, achieved by the soundness of his judgment and the subtlety of his mind.		
A2655	"I behold ""great and most marvelous sights proposed to philosophers and astronomers,"" including myself, if I am not mistaken; I behold ""all lovers of true philosophy summoned to the commencement of great observation."""		
A2656	I craved to plunge into the subject, inasmuch as I was invited; and since I had written on the same topic six years before, I yearned to discuss with you, most accomplished Galileo, in a highly agreeable kind of discourse, the many undisclosed treasures of Jehovah the creator, which He reveals to us one after another. For who is permitted to remain silent at the news of such momentous developments? Who is not filled with a surging love of God, pouring itself copiously forth through tongue and pen?

A2661	My eagerness was stimulated by the orders of the Most August Emperor Rudolph, who requested my opinion about this subject.		
A2662	Therefore, either this world is itself infinite, as Melissus thought and also the Englishman William Gilbert, the founder of the science of magnetism; or, as Democritus and Leucippus taught, and among the moderns, Bruno and Bruce, who is your friend, Galileo, as well as mine, there is an infinite number of other worlds (or earths, as Bruno puts it) similar to ours.		
A2663	You did me the honor of thinking that so great a man in particular should encourage me to write; and you sent along a copy of the book and added your own admonition.		
A2664	against the obstinate critics of innovation, for whom anything unfamiliar is unbelievable, for whom anything outside the traditional boundaries of Aristotelian narrowmindedness is wicked and abominable, you may advance reinforced by one partisan.

A2668	why should I not believe a most learned mathematician, whose very style attests the soundness of his judgment? He has no intention of practicing deception in a bid for vulgar publicity, nor does he pretend to have seen what he has not seen. Because he loves the truth, he does not hesitate to oppose even the most familiar opinions, and to bear the jeers of the crowd with equanimity.

Does he not make his writings public, and could he possibly hide any villainy that might be perpetrated? Shall I disparage him, a gentleman of Florence, for the things he has seen? Shall I with my poor vision disparage him with his keen sight? Shall he with his equipment of optical instruments be disparaged by me, who must use my naked eyes because I lack these aids? Shall I not have confidence in him, when he invites everybody to see the same sights, and what is of supreme importance, even offers his own instrument in order to gain support on the strength of observations?		
A2672	Why is it that I find part of the book verified by my own experience and also by the affirmations of others?		
A2673	this story of the spots in the moon is also quite ancient. It is supported by the authority of Pythagoras and Plutarch,		
A2674	Their conclusions agree with the highly illuminating observations which you report on the same subject. Consequently I have no basis for questioning the rest of your book and the four satellites of Jupiter.		
A2675	I shall discuss with you, Galileo, things which are absolutely certain and which may be seen, I confidently hope, with my own eyes.		
A2676	I am aware how great a difference there is between theoretical speculation and visual experience; between Ptolemy's discussion of the antipodes and Columbus' discovery of the New World, and likewise between the widely distributed tubes with two lenses and the apparatus with which you, Galileo, have pierced the heavens. But here I am trying to induce the skeptical to have faith in your instrument.		
A2677	But here I am trying to induce the skeptical to have faith in your instrument.		
A2678	Putting aside all misgivings, you turned directly to visual experimentation. And indeed by your discoveries you caused the sun of truth to rise, you routed all the ghosts of perplexity together with their mother, the night, and by your achievement you showed what could be done.		
A2679	by your discoveries you caused the sun of truth to rise		
A2680	Putting aside all misgivings, you turned directly to visual experimentation.		
A2681	My intention is to avoid what is illustrated by the diagram on page 194, namely, distortion and confusion of the parts of the object under observation,		
A2682	These are the conditions, I say, which I shall observe in setting up the convex lens, for the purpose of magnifying objects in the field of vision. I shall place the eye not far from the spot where the rays from all points of the object under observation converge at a common focus (this is the function of the hyperbolic nipple). The hyperbola will be extended so far that a ray from this point or center will make an angle of 27° with the tangent at the edge of the hyperbola, and will therefore be refracted about 9°. Thus I shall have at either edge a refraction of about 30 1/2°, but proportionally less in between.  Now the rays from a single point of an object shining so far away come down to the nipple practically parallel. Thereafter they converge and enter the crystalline lens of the eye. Being refracted by the crystalline lens, they meet at a point close behind it. Then they diverge again until, spreading out as though from the tip of a pencil, they strike the retina. Thus from every point on the moon light falls on a separate area of the retina, so that the image becomes quite confused. Therefore I shall adapt a concave lens to the individual eye of each observer in accordance with the variations in their vision. In this way the convergence of the rays from any one point will be stopped by a refraction in the opposite direction accomplished by the concave lens. The rays will diverge instead, and will enter the crystalline lens as though they were coming from some nearby point. After being refracted by the crystalline lens, they will find their points of convergence on the retina itself. This is the definition of clear vision.		
A2683	his discussion of their construction (which he also explains) is so involved that you do not know what he is talking about, whether he is still dealing with transparent lenses, as in the previous chapter, or introducing an opaque polished mirror.		
A2684	the Emperor questioned me quite frequently about Della Porta's aforementioned devices. I must confess that I disparaged them most vigorously, and no wonder, for he obviously mixes up the incredible with the probable.		
A2685	Under your guidance I recognize that the celestial substance is incredibly tenuous.		
A2686	if fate smiles on me so that I can overcome the obstacles and attempt the mechanical construction, I shall exert myself energetically in that endeavor, pursuing alternative courses. On the one hand, I shall increase the number of lenses. They will have on either side perfectly spherical surfaces of very slight curvature. I shall place them at fixed intervals in the tube, the outer lenses being a little wider. Even so, the eye will be located within the limits of the area where parallel rays passing through all the lenses converge; with regard to these limits, see pages 190 and 440 of my “Optics.” On the other hand, to enable me more easily to correct the aberration (should there be any) in a single surface, I shall design a lens shaped like a nipple, to be used by itself. One of its surfaces will be practically plane, because its curvature will amount to only 1/2 or 30’ of a spherically convex shell. The other surface, which is directed toward the eye, will not be spherical. My intention is to avoid what is illustrated by the diagram on page 194, namely, distortion and confusion of the parts of the object under observation, the subject treated in Proposition 18 on page 193. Instead, the second surface will take the shape of a nipple, as shown in the diagram on page 198. Hence it will resemble the crystalline lens of the eye, because it will be bounded by the curvature of a hyperbolic line. This is the figure which I sought in the diagram on page 106 for the sake of optical devices, as indicated on pages 96 and 109. The aim is to achieve undistorted vision, in which the images of the parts of the object under observation are enlarged proportionally, as set forth on page 105.		
A2687	you have certainly discovered an ingenious method of ascertaining to what extent objects are magnified by your instrument, and how individual minutes and fractions of minutes can be discerned in the heavens		
A2688	Johannes Pistorius, asked me more than once, I recall, whether Brahe’s observations were so refined that in my opinion absolutely nothing could be lacking in them. I vigorously maintained that the pinnacle had been reached, and that nothing further was left to human enterprise, because the eyes would not permit greater precision, nor would the effect of refraction, which alters the position of the stars with reference to the horizon. In rebuttal, he steadfastly declared that some day somebody would come along who would devise a more exact procedure with the help of lenses. I objected on the ground that their refractive properties made lenses unsuitable for reliable observations. But now at last I see that Pistorius was in part a true prophet. To be sure, Brahe's observations speak for themselves and need no praise. For what an arc of 60° is in the heavens, or 34’, is known through Brahe instruments by themselves. But whereas Brahe in this way measured celestial degrees in the heavens (or even I determined the diameter of the moon by my optical device), now your telescope, Galileo, surpasses these attainments. Accepting the numerical results recorded by Brahe and me, it subdivides them with the utmost nicety into minutes and fractions of minutes. It couples itself with Brahe's observational method in a most appropriate marriage, so that Brahe has good reason to rejoice at your method of observation, and you must base your method on Brahe’s.		
A2689	Would you like me to express my feelings? I want your instrument for the study of lunar eclipses, in the hope that it may furnish the most extraordinary aid in improving and where necessary in recasting, the whole of my “Hipparchus” or demonstration of the sizes and distances of the three bodies, sun, moon, and earth. For the variations in the solar and lunar diameters, and the portion of the moon that is eclipsed, will be measured with precision only by the man who is equipped with your telescope and acquires skill in observing.

A2691	Therefore let Galileo take his stand by Kepler's side. Let the former observe the moon with his face turned skyward, while the latter studies the sun by looking down at a screen (lest the lens injure his eye). Let each employ his own device, and from this partnership may there some day arise an absolutely perfect theory of the distances.

A2694	If a comet appears, it will be possible to make highly accurate observations of its parallax (like the moon's) by comparison with those quite minute and very numerous stars which are visible only through your instrument. From the parallax measurements we may draw more definite conclusions than we have ever had before about the height of comets.		
A2695	From the parallax measurements we may draw more definite conclusions than we have ever had before about the height of comets.		
A2696	"Your remarks remind me of what I said, on the basis of Plutarch, Mastlin, and my own observations, in my ""Optical Part of Astronomy,"" Chapter VI, ""The Light of the Heavenly Bodies,"" Number 9, ""The Spots on the Moon."""		
A2697	it occurs to me to compete with you in scrutinizing those small spots first noticed by you in the brighter region. Yet, if this is agreed upon, I hope to get results by my own method of observation, with my back to the moon. I shall admit the light of the moon through an aperture to a sheet of paper mounted on a rod. The aperture will be fitted with a crystal lens curving spherically from a circular edge. The paper will be adjusted to the focus of the rays. In this way, with a rod 12 feet long, a perfect image of the body of the moon will be obtained the size of a large silver coin.		
A2698	The paper will be adjusted to the focus of the rays. In this way, with a rod 12 feet long, a perfect image of the body of the moon will be obtained the size of a large silver coin.		
A2699	I explained the device in Proposition 23 on page 196 of my book, and on page 211.		
A2700	you begin your observations by specifying the age of the moon, and for the first time you point out the imperfections of the oval line in the crescent phase. In Number 8 on page 244 of my book I showed that the circle of illumination appears as an oval. What you say, then, is correct and in full accord with mathematics.		
A2701	In your discussion of the spots first noticed by you in the bright region of the moon, you show in a thorough optical analysis of the illumination that they are hollow or sunken cavities in the body of the moon. But you provoke a dispute over the nature of those numerous spots in what has been regarded from ancient times as the bright region of the moon. You compare them with the valleys on our earth.		
A2702	you show in a thorough optical analysis		
A2703	you provoke a dispute over the nature of those numerous spots in what has been regarded from ancient times as the bright region of the moon		
A2704	these suggestions (about cavities that are below the surface and not cut through the mountains) are not so weighty that I would deem them worthy of a stubborn defense, should they be rendered completely untenable by your subsequent reports. For you have established most firmly by brilliant observations in full accord with the laws of optics that many peaks tower above the body of the moon, throughout the bright region, especially in the lower portion.		
A2705	these suggestions (about cavities that are below the surface and not cut through the mountains) are not so weighty that I would deem them worthy of a stubborn defense, should they be rendered completely untenable by your subsequent reports.		
A2706	For you have established most firmly by brilliant observations in full accord with the laws of optics that many peaks tower above the body of the moon, throughout the bright region, especially in the lower portion. Like the loftiest mountains on our earth, they are the first to enjoy the light of the sun as it rises for the moon, and are thereby revealed to you when you make use of your telescope.		
A2707	I cited the opinion of Plutarch, who regarded those ancient spots on the moon as lakes or seas, and the bright areas as continents. I did not hesitate to oppose him and to reverse his interpretation, by attributing the spots to continents, and the purity of the bright region to the effects of a liquid.		
A2708	"My motive in contradicting Plutarch in this regard may be seen on page 251 of my book. I there report an observation which I performed on Mt. Schockel in Styria. From my vantage point the river below looked bright, and the land darker. But the flaw in my reasoning is indicated in the margin of the very next page. Obviously the river did not, like the land, shine by light received from the sun, but by light reflected from the illuminated air. Hence my analysis of the causes of the phenomenon was also unfortunate. For, in opposition to the doctrine of Aristotle's book ""On Colors,"" I asserted that water partakes of black less than earth does. Yet how could this be true, since earth turns darker when it is soaked with water? But why go on at length?"		
A2709	"But the flaw in my reasoning is indicated in the margin of the very next page.

Yet how could this be true, since earth turns darker when it is soaked with water? But why go on at length?"		
A2710	My book, consequently, does not prevent me from agreeing with you, as you adduce mathematical arguments against me in favor of Plutarch with brilliant and irrefutable logic		
A2711	By these arguments, I say, you have proved your point completely. I admit that the spots are seas, I admit that the bright areas are land.		
A2712	"These very acute observations of yours do not lack the support of even my own testimony. For on page 248 of my ""Optics"" you have the half-moon divided by a wavy line. From this fact I deduced peaks and depressions in the body of the moon. On page 250 I describe the moon during an eclipse as looking like torn flesh or broken wood, with bright streaks penetrating into the region in shadow. On the basis of this observation I establish the conclusion, identical with yours, yet reached by a different sort of reasoning, that the parts of the moon are uneven, some being higher and others lower."		
A2713	I made these suggestions, however, only in a confused and superficial way, without distinguishing between the spots and the bright region. But under your skillful handling how simple everything becomes! You show that even the ancient spots themselves are sprinkled with small, level, whitish areas, like seas dotted with conspicuous islands.		
A2714	Pages 252 and 302 of my book could have told you about this air on the moon. These passages in my book are splendidly confirmed by your pertinent observations.		
A2715	These passages in my book are splendidly confirmed by your pertinent observations		
A2716	Suppose that there are living beings on the moon (following in the footsteps of Pythagoras and Plutarch, I enjoyed toying with this idea, long ago in a disputation written at Tübingen in the year 1593, later on in my “Optics” on page 250, and most recently in my aforementioned lunar geography). It surely stands to reason that the inhabitants express the character of their dwelling place, which has much bigger mountains and valleys than our earth has. Consequently, being endowed with very massive bodies, they also construct gigantic projects. Their day is as long as 15 of our days, and they feel insufferable heat. Perhaps they lack stone for erecting shelters against the sun. On the other hand, maybe they have a soil as sticky as clay. Their usual building plan, accordingly, is as follows. Digging up huge fields, they carry out the earth and heap it in a circle, perhaps for the purpose of drawing out the moisture down below. In this way they may hide deep in the shade behind their excavated mounds and, in keeping with the sun's motion, shift about inside, clinging to the shadow. They have, as it were, a sort of underground city. They make their homes in numerous caves hewn out of that circular embankment. They place their fields and pastures in the middle, to avoid being forced to go too far away from their farms in their flight from the sun.		
A2717	This situation would be consistent with my observations.		
A2718	"Hence he concludes that the material at the limb is transparent, as though made of glass, airy, and homogeneous, in short, quite similar to the air around our earth.  Indeed, he devotes much space to proving the existence of this air, as you do, Galileo, by the following evidence: ""the portion that is bathed in sunlight appears to have a larger circumference than the rest of the globe, which is in shadow."" Mästlin demonstrates this by many observations."		
A2719	These were performed not only at night, when the explanation might be referred to the conditions of seeing, but also by day, when Venus disappears behind the part of the half-moon that is in shadow.		
A2720	The next item in your little book is the ingenious and sound proof on page 13 of what I too mentioned casually on page 250, but failed to demonstrate. The mountains on the moon are much bigger than those on the earth, not merely in relation to their globes, as I put it, but absolutely. In order to prove this proposition, of course, your telescope was needed, and your observational skill.		
A2721	No less ingenious is your arrangement on page 14 inspecting the disk of the moon when its horns first emerge. You explain how to observe from behind a roof so that the horns are covered up and the rest of the disk becomes visible. This is an observational method very familiar to me.		
A2722	There, adopting a procedure identical with yours, I too reject the same suppositions (that this light comes from the sun or from Venus), except that I treat the latter conjecture on its merits somewhat more favorably than you do.		
A2723	"You support my discussion of this redness on page 271 of the “Optics,"" where I derive it from the refraction of the sun's rays in our atmosphere. You also enhance the usefulness of what I said on page 301 by way of explaining why complete darkness does not always occur during a total eclipse of the sun; I repeated these remarks on page 117 in my book on the “New Star.”"		
A2724	"I doubt, Galileo, whether the cause proposed by you can account for this redness. For this dawn-light, as you call it, surrounds the body of the moon much too uniformly to be the source of the redness, which is distributed so unevenly over the moon. This is shown by my observations, as reported on page 276. When you consider this subject in your ""System of the Universe,"" you will, I trust, advance a much more successful explanation of the causes of the phenomena under discussion."		
A2725	I readily grant that, as compared with the celestial bodies in the vicinity of the sun, which I regarded on page 277 as the cause of the pale light, this dawn-light of yours serves as a better explanation.		
A2726	When their small bodies are examined through the telescope, you say that they shrink in comparison with the diameter of the moon. You also mention other things, which truly produce a similar diminution of the stars, as I have known from long experience: twilight, daylight, a cloud, a veil, colored glass.		
A2727	"I should like to ask you, Galileo, whether you are satisfied with the reasons for this effect, as presented by me in my discussion of the process of vision on page 217 and especially on page 221 of my ""Optics."" For if you find nothing amiss, you may hereafter discuss the matter correctly."		
A2728	Point sources of light transmit their cones to the crystalline lens. There refraction takes place, and behind the lens the cones again contract to a point. But this point does not reach as far as the retina. Therefore the light is dispersed once more, and spreads over a small area of the retina, whereas it should impinge on a point. Hence the telescope, by introducing another refraction, makes this point coincide with the retina. It is not true, then, that some rays come down to the eye from the brightness enveloping the stars on the outside. On the contrary, the rays which come down from the shining body itself are scattered, as a result of refraction and the widening of the opening in the uvea at night. They brighten the area on the retina around the point which should represent the star. The telescope on earth does not remove anything from the stars in heaven, but it does take away from the retina whatever light is superfluous.		
A2729	The telescope on earth does not remove anything from the stars in heaven, but it does take away from the retina whatever light is superfluous		
A2730	persons with unimpaired vision, using astronomical instruments that are not deceived by these wavy crowns, as is the naked eye, ascertain the dimensions of the stars' diameters in terms of minutes and fractions of minutes		
A2731	You have a large number of eyewitnesses to the innumerability of the stars. The rabbis are said to enumerate more than 12,000. A clergyman of my acquaintance one moonless night counted over 40 in Orion's Shield. The larger stars in the Pleiades are arranged in order by Mästlin to the number of fourteen		
A2732	You have conferred a blessing on astronomers and physicists by revealing the true character of the Milky Way, the nebulae, and the nebulous spirals. You have upheld those writers who long ago reached the same conclusion as you: they are nothing but a mass of stars, whose luminosities blend on account of the dullness of our eyes.  Accordingly, scientists will henceforth cease to create comets and new stars out of the Milky Way, after the manner of Brahe, lest they irrationally assert the passing away of perfect and eternal celestial bodies.		
A2733	Accordingly, scientists will henceforth cease to create comets and new stars out of the Milky Way, after the manner of Brahe, lest they irrationally assert the passing away of perfect and eternal celestial bodies.		
A2734	What Galileo recently saw with his own eyes, it had many years before not only proposed as a surmise, but thoroughly established by reasoning. It is doubtless with perfect justice that those men attain fame whose intellect anticipates the senses in closely related branches of philosophy. Theoretical astronomy, at a time when it had never set foot outside Greece, nevertheless disclosed the characteristics of the Arctic Zone. Who then would not rank it in nobility above Caesar's experience of learning from the water-clocks that the nights on the coasts of Britain are a little shorter than the nights in Rome, or above the Dutchmen's spending the winter in the north, an expedition which was indeed wonderful, but which would have been impossible without  that theoretical knowledge? Who does not honor Plato's myth of Atlantis, Plutarch's legend of the gold-colored islands beyond Thule, and Seneca's prophetic verses about the forthcoming discovery of a New World, now that the evidence for such a place has finally been furnished by that Argonaut from Florence? Columbus himself keeps his readers uncertain whether to admire his intellect in divining the New World from the direction of the winds, more than his courage in facing unknown seas and the boundless ocean, and his good luck in gaining his objective.		
A2735	In my own field too, the prodigies will naturally be Pythagoras, Plato, and Euclid. Borne aloft by the preeminence of their reason, they argued that God could not have done otherwise than to arrange the world on the model of the five regular solids. But they mistook the pattern. On the other hand, the plaudits of the average man will go to Copernicus who, equipped with a mind that was not average, yet drew a picture of the universe virtually as it is seen by the eye. But he brought to light only the bare facts. Trailing far behind the ancients will be Kepler. From the visual outlook of the Copernican system he rises, as it were, from the facts to the causes, and to the same explanation as Plato from on high had set forth deductively so many centuries before. He shows that the Copernican system of the world exhibits the reason for the five Platonic solids.		
A2736	those thinkers who intellectually grasp the causes of phenomena, before these are revealed to the senses, resemble the Creator more closely than the others, who speculate about the causes after the phenomena have been seen.		
A2737	Galileo, you will not envy our predecessors their due praise. What you report as having been quite recently observed by your own eyes, they predicted, long before you, as necessarily so. Nevertheless, you will have your own fame. Copernicus and I, as a Copernican, pointed out to the ancients the mistaken way in which they considered the five solids to be expressed in the world, and we substituted the authentic and true way. Similarly, you correct and, in part, unsettle Bruce's doctrine, borrowed from Bruno.		
A2738	These men thought that other celestial bodies have their own moons revolving around them, like our earth with its moon. But you prove that they were talking in generalities. Moreover, they supposed it was the fixed stars that are so accompanied. Bruno even expounded the reason why this must be so. The fixed stars, forsooth, have the quality of sun and fire, but the planets, of water. By an indefeasible law of nature these opposites combine. The sun cannot be deprived of the planets; the fire, of its water; nor in turn the water, of the fire. Now the weakness of his reasoning is exposed by your observations.		
A2739	this will remain an open question until this phenomenon too is detected by someone equipped for marvelously refined observations		
A2740	Therefore, for the sake of those who, as it were, will presently be on hand to attempt this voyage, let us establish the astronomy, Galileo, you of Jupiter, and me of the moon.		
A2741	as soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying, settlers from our species of man will not be lacking. Who would once have thought that the crossing of the wide ocean was calmer and safer than of the narrow Adriatic Sea, Baltic Sea, or English Channel? Given ships or sails adapted to the breezes of heaven, there will be those who will not shrink from even that vast

A2743	Given ships or sails adapted to the breezes of heaven, there will be those who will not shrink from even that vast		
A2744	I have also thought it worth while, in passing, to tweak the ear of the higher philosophy. Let it ponder the questions whether the almighty and provident Guardian of the human race permits anything useless and why, like an experienced steward, He opens the inner chambers of his building to us at this particular time. Such was the opinion put forward by my good friend Thomas Seget, a man of wide learning. Or does God the creator, as I replied, lead mankind, like some growing youngster gradually approaching maturity, step by step from one stage of knowledge to another?		
A2745	does God the creator, as I replied, lead mankind, like some growing youngster gradually approaching maturity, step by step from one stage of knowledge to another?		
A2746	Let the higher philosophy reflect, I repeat, and glance backward to some extent. How far has the knowledge of nature progressed, how much is left, and what may the men of the future expect?		
A2747	We should not anticipate that all of us, equipped with your telescopes, Galileo, will observe them hereafter as a matter of course		
A2748	Well, then, someone may say, if there are globes in the heaven similar to our earth, do we vie with them over who occupies the better portion of the universe? For if their globes are nobler, we are not the noblest of rational creatures. Then how can all things be for man's sake? How can we be the masters of God's handiwork?		
A2749	It is difficult to unravel this knot, because we have not yet acquired all the relevant information. We shall hardly escape being labeled foolish if we expatiate at length on this subject.		
A2750	this system of planets, on one of which we humans dwell, is located in the very bosom of the world, around the heart of the universe, that is, the sun. These arguments will also establish in particular that we humans live on the globe which by right belongs to the primary rational creature, the noblest of the (corporeal) creatures.		
A2751	Geometry is unique and eternal, and it shines in the mind of God. The share of it which has been granted to man is one of the reasons why he is the image of God		
A2752	""" in the interests of that contemplation for which man was created, and adorned and equipped with eyes, he could not remain at rest in the center. On the contrary, he must make an annual journey on this boat, which is our earth, to perform his observations. So surveyors, in measuring inaccessible objects, move from place to place for the purpose of obtaining from the distance between their positions an accurate base line for the triangulation."		
A2753	Let the Jovians, I repeat, have their own planets. We humans who inhabit the earth can with good reason (in my view) feel proud of the preeminent lodging place of our bodies, and we should be grateful to God the creator.		
A2754	You have good reason to wonder why the Medicean planets display so great a variation in size. Three explanations which anybody could invent, you refute neatly and mathematically		
A2755	It remains for me to make an urgent request of you, most illustrious Galileo. Press on vigorously with your observations, and let us know at the very earliest opportunity what results your observations have attained		
A2756	I promised to prepare something in time for the scheduled departure of the couriers, and I kept my pledge.		
A2757	I resolved to advise the reader that everybody has his own preference		
A2758	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said		
A2759	I have never belittled or laid false claim to the ideas of others, when I had none of my own.		
A2760	I have never fawned on others, nor have I been self-effacing if I made some better or prior discovery by my own exertions.		
A2761	I do not think that Galileo, an Italian, has treated me, a German, so well that in return I must flatter him, with injury to the truth or to my deepest convictions.		
A2762	let no one assume that by my readiness to agree with Galileo I propose to deprive others of their right to disagree with him		
A2763	all men are free to make up their own minds		
A2764	their right to disagree		
A2765	I swear to reject them without reservation, as soon as any better informed person points out an error to me by a sound method		
A2766	points out an error to me by a sound method		
A2767	I supposed that among others Galileo too, the most highly qualified of all, would discuss with me by mail the new kind of astronomy or celestial physics which I had published, and that he would resume our interrupted correspondence, which had begun twelve years before.		
A2768	But why should I not believe a most learned mathematician, whose very style attests the soundness of his judgment? He has no intention of practicing deception in a bid for vulgar publicity, nor does he pretend to have seen what he has not seen.		
A2769	mutually self-supporting evidence.		
A2770	great a difference there is between theoretical speculation and visual experience		
A2771	Putting aside all misgivings, you turned directly to visual experimentation		
A2772	by your achievement you showed what could be done		
A2773	discovered an ingenious method of ascertaining to what extent objects are magnified by your instrument		
A2774	Let each employ his own device, and from this partnership may there some day arise an absolutely perfect theory of the distances		
A2775	Hence it occurs to me to compete with you in scrutinizing those small spots first noticed by you in the brighter region. Yet, if this is agreed upon, I hope to get results by my own method of observation, with my back to the moon.		
A2776	a perfect image of the body of the moon will be obtained the size of a large silver coin		
A2777	What you say, then, is correct and in full accord with mathematics.		
A2778	But these suggestions (about cavities that are below the surface and not cut through the mountains) are not so weighty that I would deem them worthy of a stubborn defense, should they be rendered completely untenable by your subsequent reports.		
A2779	you have established most firmly by brilliant observations in full accord with the laws of optics		
A2780	I cited the opinion of Plutarch, who regarded those ancient spots on the moon as lakes or seas, and the bright areas as continents. I did not hesitate to oppose him and to reverse his interpretation		
A2781	My motive in contradicting Plutarch in this regard may be seen on page 251 of my book.		
A2782	But the flaw in my reasoning is indicated in the margin of the very next page		
A2783	"in opposition to the doctrine of Aristotle's book ""On Colors,"" I asserted that water partakes of black less than earth does"		
A2784	you adduce mathematical arguments against me in favor of Plutarch with brilliant and irrefutable logic		
A2785	ou adduce mathematical arguments against me in favor of Plutarch with brilliant and irrefutable logic		
A2786	These very acute observations of yours do not lack the support of even my own testimony		
A2787	On the basis of this observation I establish the conclusion, identical with yours, yet reached by a different sort of reasoning		
A2788	and once again tell us how it looks to you		
A2789	Mästlin demonstrates this by many observations		
A2790	The next item in your little book is the ingenious and sound proof on page 13 of what I too mentioned casually on page 250, but failed to demonstrate		
A2791	No less ingenious is your arrangement on page 14 inspecting the disk of the moon when its horns first emerge.

A2892	"Tomorrow is our wedding day."" When the king's daughter saw that there was no more hope to change her father's mind, she made the decision to run away"		
A2893	During the night, while everyone was asleep, she got up and took three things from among her valuables: a golden ring, a little golden spinning wheel, and a little golden reel. She put the three dresses from the sun, moon, and stars into a nutshell, put on the cloak of all kinds of fur, blackened her hands and face with soot. Then surrendering herself to God, she set forth. She walked the entire night until she came to a great forest. Being tired, she sat down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.		
A2894	Then surrendering herself to God, she set forth.		
A2895	The huntsmen followed his command		
A2896	"""I am a poor child who has been abandoned by her father and mother. Have pity on me and take me with you."""		
A2897	Have pity on me and take me with you		
A2898	Then she was sent to the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, tended the fire, plucked the poultry, sorted vegetables, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work.		
A2899	"""This is where you can live and sleep, you furry little animal."" Then she was sent to the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, tended the fire, plucked the poultry, sorted vegetables, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work"		
A2900	"""A strange animal, like none we have ever seen before, is lying in the hollow tree"		
A2901	"""May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door."" The cook answered, ""Yes, go ahead. But you have to be back here in a half hour and carry out the ashes."""		
A2902	"The king approached her, reached his hand out to her, and danced with her, and thought in his heart, ""My eyes have never before seen such beauty."""		
A2903	Now she had run back to her cubbyhole, quickly taken off her dress, blackened her hands and face, put on the fur cloak, and was once again All-Kinds-of-Fur.		
A2904	Then the cook went away, and All-Kinds-of-Fur made soup for the king. She made bread soup, and as good as she knew how.		
A2905	When it was done, she got her golden ring from the cubbyhole and placed it in the bowl that the soup was in.		
A2906	", ""For sure you let a hair fall into the soup. If that's true, you'll get a beating."""		
A2907	"but don't let a hair fall into it, or in the future there will nothing more for you to eat."""		
A2908	", ""I cooked it."""		
A2909	"That is not true, for it was made in a different way, and much better than usual."""		
A2910	"""I must confess that I did not cook it, it was the little furry animal."		
A2911	"When All-Kinds-of-Fur arrived, the king asked, ""Who are you."" ""I am a poor child who no longer has a father or a mother."" He asked further, ""What are you doing in my castle?"" She answered, ""I am good for nothing, except having boots thrown at my head."" He asked further, ""Where did you get the ring that was in the soup?"" She answered, ""I do not know anything about the ring."""		
A2912	The king came up to her and was delighted to see her again, and because a dance was just beginning, they danced together.		
A2913	She ran to her cubbyhole, quickly washed herself then took from the nut the dress that was as silver as the moon and put it on.		
A2914	She ran to her cubbyhole, turned herself back into a furry animal, and went to the kitchen to make the bread soup		
A2915	she answered that she was only good for having boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all about the little golden spinning wheel.		
A2916	"""You are a witch, you furry animal, always putting something in the soup that makes it very good and taste better to the king."""		
A2917	he allowed her to look in on the ball at the appointed time		
A2918	The king danced again with the beautiful maiden, thinking that she had never been so beautiful.		
A2919	When it was over, he tried to keep hold of her by her hands,		
A2920	All-Kinds-of-Fur now ran into the kitchen, made the bread soup for the king, and while the cook was away, put the golden reel in it.		
A2921	"The king said, ""You are my dear bride, and we shall never part."""		
A2922	"It happened that she fell ill, and when she felt that she was about to die, she called the king to her and said, ""If you want to remarry after my death then do not take anyone who is not as beautiful as I am, and who does not have such golden hair as mine. That you must promise me."""		
A2923	"Finally his councilors said, ""There is no other way. The king must remarry, so that we will have a queen."""		
A2924	Then messengers were sent out far and wide to seek a bride, who in beauty was entirely the equal of the deceased queen. However, no such bride could be found in the whole world.		
A2925	"Hoping to dissuade him from his intentions, she said to him, ""Before I fulfill your wish, I must have three dresses: one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one that glistens like the stars. Further, I must have a cloak put together from a thousand kinds of pelts and fur. Every animal in your kingdom must contribute a piece of its skin for it."" Now she thought, ""That will be entirely impossible for him to achieve, and in this way I will divert my father from his wicked thoughts."""		
A2926	"Now one day it happened that a banquet was being held in the castle, and she said to the cook, ""May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door."""		
A2927	Taking off her fur cloak, she washed the soot from her hands and face so that her full beauty again came to light. Then she opened the nut and took out her dress that glistened like the sun. And after she had done all this she went upstairs to the banquet. Everyone stepped out of her way, for no one knew her, and everyone thought that she was a princess.		
A2928	"He ordered the cook to come before him. The cook was terrified when he heard this order, and he said to All-Kinds-of-Fur, ""For sure you let a hair fall into the soup. If that's true, you'll get a beating."""		
A2929	"The cook answered, ""I must confess that I did not cook it, it was the little furry animal."""		
A2930	Some time later there was another banquet, and All-Kinds-of-Fur, as before, asked the cook for permission to have a look.		
A2931	Then she went upstairs and looked like a princess. The king came up to her and was delighted to see her again, and because a dance was just beginning, they danced together. But as soon as the dance was over she again disappeared so quickly that the king did not notice where she went.		
A2932	He had the cook brought before him, who again had to confess that All-Kinds-of-Fur had made the soup		
A2933	"""You are a witch, you furry animal, always putting something in the soup that makes it very good and taste better to the king."" But because she asked, he allowed her to look in on the ball at the appointed time."		
A2934	Catching sight of the white finger, he saw the ring that he had put on her while they were dancing.		
A2935	"The king said, ""You are my dear bride, and we shall never part."" Then their wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily until they died."		
A2936	All-Kinds-of-Fur lived there miserable for a long time. Oh, you beautiful princess, what will become of you?		
A2937	"Make the king's soup for me, so I can have a look upstairs, but don't let a hair fall into it, or in the future there will nothing more for you to eat."" Then the cook went away, and All-Kinds-of-Fur made soup for the king. She made bread soup, and as good as she knew how. When it was done, she got her golden ring from the cubbyhole and placed it in the bowl that the soup was in."		
A2938	"He ordered the cook to come before him. The cook was terrified when he heard this order, and he said to All-Kinds-of-Fur, ""For sure you let a hair fall into the soup. If that's true, you'll get a beating."" When the cook came before the king he was asked who had cooked the soup, and he answered, ""I cooked it."""		
A2939	Thus the king could learn nothing, and he had to send her away again.		
A2940	The king danced again with the beautiful maiden, thinking that she had never been so beautiful. And while he was dancing he placed a golden ring on her finger, without her noticing it.		
A2941	king had promised her this,		
A2942	"The king must remarry, so that we will have a queen."""		
A2943	"If you want to remarry after my death then do not take anyone who is not as beautiful as I am, and who does not have such golden hair as mine. That you must promise me."""		
A2944	"""Before I fulfill your wish, I must have three dresses: one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one that glistens like the stars. Further, I must have a cloak put together from a thousand kinds of pelts and fur. Every animal in your kingdom must contribute a piece of its skin for it."""		
A2945	Hoping to dissuade him from his intentions,		
A2946	When the king's daughter saw that there was no more hope to change her father's mind, she made the decision to run away.		
A2947	"""May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door."""		
A2948	"""That's enough until tomorrow. Make the king's soup for me, so I can have a look upstairs, but don't let a hair fall into it, or in the future there will nothing more for you to eat."""		
A2949	she got her golden ring from the cubbyhole and placed it in the bowl that the soup was in.		
A2950	While the cook was upstairs she got the golden spinning wheel and put it in the bowl, so that the soup was prepared on top of it.		
A2951	he placed a golden ring on her finger, without her noticing it.		
A2952	As she attempted to free herself and run away,		
A2953	he saw the ring that he had put on her while they were dancing.		
A2954	Then their wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily until they died		
A2955	and nowhere else can I find a bride who is her equal.		
A2956	"""For sure you let a hair fall into the soup. If that's true, you'll get a beating."""		
A2957	faithful		
A2958	Faithful Johannes was his favorite servant, and was so called, because he had been so loyal to him for his whole life long

A2961	will serve him faithfully, even if it costs me my life.

A2963	Most faithful Johannes		
A2964	After faithful Johannes had once more given his promise to the old king about this		
A2965	"I will not be able to close my eyes in peace if you do not promise to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster father."" Faithful Johannes answered, ""I will not forsake him,"		
A2966	"""I will surely keep my promise, and will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him, even if it should cost me my life."""		
A2967	will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him, even if it should cost me my life.		
A2968	"""There is something in there that would frighten you."""		
A2969	I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber.		
A2970	"""Misfortune has befallen us, dear Lord."		
A2971	My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they would not be able to express it. I will risk my life to win her.		
A2972	will risk my life to win her.		
A2973	You are my most faithful Johannes.		
A2974	"Finally he thought of a way, and said to the king, ""Everything which she has about her is of gold -- tables, chairs, dishes, cups, bowls, and household implements. Among your treasures are five tons of gold. Have the royal goldsmiths fashion one ton into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts, and strange animals. She will like these things, and we will go there with them and to try our luck."		
A2975	"""Oh, whose portrait is that beautiful picture?"" ""That is the Princess of the Golden Roof"		
A2976	"""That is the Princess of the Golden Roof,"""		
A2977	"""I am only the servant of a rich merchant. The things I have here are not to be compared with those my master has in his ship. They are the most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in gold."""		
A2978	"""I have seen the entire castle, and I want to know what is in this room as well."""		
A2979	"You must help me."" The faithful servant thought to himself for a long time how to approach the matter, for it was difficult even to come into view of the king's daughter. Finally he thought of a way,"		
A2980	This made her all the more curious and desirous,		
A2981	curious		
A2982	"""I am not a merchant. I am a king,"		
A2983	I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are.		
A2984	Many hours went by while she was looking at everything,		
A2985	If I have tricked you into coming with me, it is only because of my great love for you. The first time I saw your portrait, I fell to the ground unconscious.		
A2986	Her heart yielded to him, and she willingly consented to marry him.		
A2987	When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will leap up into the air with him, and he will never see his bride again.

A2993	"The young king saw what had happened, and not knowing why faithful Johannes had done it, grew angry and shouted, ""Throw him into prison."""		
A2994	The next morning faithful Johannes was condemned and led to the gallows.

A3011	The king was horrified when he heard that he would have to kill his own dearest children, but he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty, and how he had died for him, then drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children's heads.		
A3012	he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty		
A3013	and how he had died for him,

A3020	"""Have faithful Johannes come to me."""		
A3021	Faithful Johannes was his favorite servant, and was so called, because he had been so loyal to him for his whole life long.

A3027	After faithful Johannes had once more given his promise to the old king about this, the latter said no more, but laid his head on his pillow and died.		
A3028	"After the old king had been carried to his grave, faithful Johannes told the young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said, ""I will surely keep my promise, and will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him, even if it should cost me my life."""		
A3029	Then he took him everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches and the magnificent chambers. But there was one chamber which he did not open, the one that contained the dangerous portrait.		
A3030	Now the portrait was so placed that when the door was opened one looked straight at it. It was so masterfully painted that it seemed to live and breathe and to be the most charming beautiful thing in the whole world.

I shall not leave here until you have unlocked the door."""		
A3033	After opening the door, he went in first, thinking that he could block king's view of the portrait, that the king would not see it in front of him. But what good did it do? The king stood on tiptoes and saw the portrait over faithful Johannes's shoulder.		
A3034	"You are my most faithful Johannes. You must help me."""

A3084	I will not be able to close my eyes in peace if you do not promise to teach him everything that he ought to know		
A3085	I want to know what is in this room as well.		
A3086	"Who knows what good may come of this?"""		
A3087	"""Who knows what good he may have done?"		
A3088	"Leave him alone. He is my most faithful Johannes."""		
A3089	And now the wedding took place. The dance began, with the bride also taking part. Faithful Johannes was watchful and looked into her face. Suddenly she turned pale and fell to the ground as if she were dead.		
A3090	"""Dear wife, we can give him his life again, but it will cost us our two little sons. We will have to sacrifice them."""		
A3091	"When she entered, he said to her, ""Have you been praying in the church?"" ""Yes, she answered, ""but I have constantly been thinking about faithful Johannes and what misfortune has befallen him because of us."""		
A3092	The king rejoiced to hear that she agreed with him		
A3093	"Have faithful Johannes come to me."""		
A3094	Faithful Johannes was his favorite servant, and was so called, because he had been so loyal to him for his whole life lon		
A3095	he had been so loyal to him for his whole life		
A3096	"Most faithful Johannes, I feel that my end is near. My only concern is for my son. He is still young and may not always have the best judgment. I will not be able to close my eyes in peace if you do not promise to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster father."""		
A3097	even if it costs me my life		
A3098	and will serve him faithfully		
A3099	Then I will die in comfort and peace		
A3100	After my death, show him the entire castle -- all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the treasures which lie therein. But do not show him the last chamber in the long gallery, which contains the portrait of the Princess of the Golden Roof. If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, will fall down unconscious, and will put himself at great risk for her sake. You must protect him from that		
A3101	If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her		
A3102	"""I will not forsake him,"		
A3103	If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, will fall down unconscious, and will put himself at great risk for her sake. You must protect him from that		
A3104	faithful Johannes told the young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed		
A3105	"and said, ""I will surely keep my promise, and will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him, even if it should cost me my life."""		
A3106	will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him		
A3107	even if it should cost me my life		
A3108	"""It is now time for you to see your inheritance. I will show you your father's castle."""		
A3109	Then he took him everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches and the magnificent chambers		
A3110	It was so masterfully painted that it seemed to live and breathe and to be the most charming beautiful thing in the whole world.		
A3111	"The young king noticed that faithful Johannes always walked past this one door, and said, ""Why do you never open this one for me?"" He replied, ""There is something in there that would frighten you."" The king answered ""I have seen the entire castle, and I want to know what is in this room as well."" And he was about to break open the door by force. Faithful Johannes held him back, saying, ""I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber. It could bring great misfortune on you and on me."" ""Oh, no!"" replied the young king. ""If I do not go in, it will be my certain downfall. I shall have no rest day or night until I have seen inside with my own eyes. I shall not leave here until you have unlocked the door."""		
A3112	"""I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber."		
A3113	It could bring great misfortune on you and on me.		
A3114	Faithful Johannes saw that there was no other way		
A3115	"""I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber. It could bring great misfortune on you and on me."" ""Oh, no!"" replied the young king. ""If I do not go in, it will be my certain downfall. I shall have no rest day or night until I have seen inside with my own eyes. I shall not leave here until you have unlocked the door."		
A3116	After opening the door, he went in first, thinking that he could block king's view of the portrait, that the king would not see it in front of him		
A3117	fter seeing the girl's portrait, which was so magnificent and glistened with gold and precious stones, he fell unconscious to the ground.		
A3118	"Faithful Johannes picked him up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought, ""Misfortune has befallen us, dear Lord. How will it end?"" Then he strengthened the king with wine, until he regained consciousness."		
A3119	"The king's first words were, ""Oh, whose portrait is that beautiful picture?"" ""That is the Princess of the Golden Roof,"" answered faithful Johannes."		
A3120	"The king continued, ""My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they would not be able to express it. I will risk my life to win her. You are my most faithful Johannes. You must help me."		
A3121	"My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they would not be able to express it. I will risk my life to win her. You are my most faithful Johannes. You must help me."""		
A3122	The faithful servant thought to himself for a long time how to approach the matter, for it was difficult even to come into view of the king's daughter.		
A3123	"Finally he thought of a way, and said to the king, ""Everything which she has about her is of gold -- tables, chairs, dishes, cups, bowls, and household implements. Among your treasures are five tons of gold. Have the royal goldsmiths fashion one ton into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts, and strange animals. She will like these things, and we will go there with them and to try our luck."""

She will like these things, and we will go there with them and to try our luck		
A3125	faithful Johannes disguised himself as a merchant, and the king had to do the same thing in order to make himself quite unrecognizable.		
A3126	"Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,"" he said. ""Therefore see that everything is in order. Have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated."		
A3127	"""I am a merchant,"" opening his apron, and letting her look in."		
A3128	"""Oh, what beautiful golden things,"" she cried, putting her buckets down and looking at the golden wares one after the other. Then the girl said, ""The princess must see these things. She takes such great pleasure in golden things, that she will buy all you have."""		
A3129	", ""I am only the servant of a rich merchant."		
A3130	"""There is so much that it would take a great many days to do that, and so many rooms would be required to exhibit them, that your house is not big enough."""		
A3131	"Take me to the ship. I will go there myself and see your master's treasures."""		
A3132	Take me to the ship. I will go there myself and see your master's treasures		
A3133	Faithful Johannes happily led her to the ship, and when the king beheld her, he saw that she was even more beautiful than the portrait, and he thought that his heart would surely break		
A3134	"But faithful Johannes remained with the helmsman and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying, ""Set all the sails and fly like a bird in the air."		
A3135	Inside, the king showed her the golden vessels, every one of them, and also the wild beasts and strange animals		
A3136	After she had looked at the last item, she thanked the merchant and wanted to go home,		
A3137	"After she had looked at the last item, she thanked the merchant and wanted to go home, but when she came to the side of the ship, she saw that it was on the high seas far from land, and speeding onward at full sail. ""Oh!"" she cried in alarm ""I've been betrayed. I've been kidnapped and have fallen into the power of a merchant. I would rather die!"""		
A3138	"""Oh!"" she cried in alarm ""I've been betrayed. I've been kidnapped and have fallen into the power of a merchant. I would rather die!"""		
A3139	"Taking her by the hand, the king said, ""I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are."		
A3140	"Taking her by the hand, the king said, ""I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are"		
A3141	f I have tricked you into coming with me, it is only because of my great love for you		
A3142	When the Princess of the Golden Roof was comforted when she heard this. Her heart yielded to him, and she willingly consented to marry him.		
A3143	Now it so happened that while they were sailing onward on the high sea, faithful Johannes, who was sitting at the front of the ship making music, saw three ravens flying through the air towards them		
A3144	"One cried ""Oh, he is carrying home the Princess of the Golden Roof."" ""Yes,"" replied the second, ""but he doesn't have her yet."" The third one said, ""Yes, he has her. She is sitting beside him in the ship."" Then the first one began again, crying, ""What good will that do him? When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will leap up into the air with him, and he will never see his bride again."" The second one spoke, ""Is there no escape?"" ""Oh, yes, if someone else quickly mounts it, takes the gun from its saddlebag, and shoots the horse dead, then young king will be rescued. But who knows that? And if anyone does know it, and tells it to the king, he will be turned to stone from his toes to his knees."""		
A3145	It will appear to be woven of gold and silver, but it is nothing but sulfur and pitch.		
A3146	"If he puts it on, it will burn him to the very marrow and bone."""		
A3147	"Then the second raven said, ""I know more than that. Even if the horse is killed, still the young king will not keep his bride. When they enter the castle together, a ready-made wedding shirt will be lying there on a platter. It will appear to be woven of gold and silver, but it is nothing but sulfur and pitch. If he puts it on, it will burn him to the very marrow and bone."""		
A3148	"""Oh, yes,"" replied the second raven. ""If anyone with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it up, the young king will be saved. But what good will that do? If anyone knows it and tells it to the king, half his body will become stone, from his knees to his heart."""		
A3149	If anyone with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it up, the young king will be saved. But what good will that do? If anyone knows it and tells it to the king, half his body will become stone, from his knees to his heart		
A3150	When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will leap up into the air with him, and he will never see his bride again		
A3151	if someone else quickly mounts it, takes the gun from its saddlebag, and shoots the horse dead, then young king will be rescued		
A3152	"""I know more than that. Even if the horse is killed, still the young king will not keep his bride. When they enter the castle together, a ready-made wedding shirt will be lying there on a platter. It will appear to be woven of gold and silver, but it is nothing but sulfur and pitch. If he puts it on, it will burn him to the very marrow and bone."		
A3153	"""I know still more. Even if the wedding shirt is burned up, still the young king will not have his bride. After the wedding, when the dancing begins and the young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead. If someone does not lift her up and draw three drops of blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows that reveals it, his entire body will turn to stone, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet."""		
A3154	"Then the third raven said, ""I know still more. Even if the wedding shirt is burned up, still the young king will not have his bride. After the wedding, when the dancing begins and the young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead.

A3155	she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead.		
A3156	From that time forth he became quiet and sad, for if he concealed what he had heard from his master, it would bring misfortune to the king, but if he revealed it to him, then he himself would have to sacrifice his life		
A3157	"Finally he said to himself, ""I will save my master, even if it brings destruction on myself."""		
A3158	When they landed, what the raven foretold did indeed happen		
A3159	He was about to mount it when faithful Johannes pushed in front of him, quickly jumped onto the horse, drew the gun from its saddlebag, and shot the horse.		
A3160	faithful Johannes pushed in front of him, quickly jumped onto the horse, drew the gun from its saddlebag, and shot the horse		
A3161	"The king's other servants, who were not very fond of faithful Johannes, shouted, ""How shameful to kill the beautiful animal that was to have carried the king to his castle."""		
A3162	faithful Johannes,		
A3163	faithful Johannes pushed him away, seized it with gloves, carried it quickly to the fire, and burned it up.		
A3164	pushed him away, seized it with gloves, carried it quickly to the fire, and burned it up		
A3165	"The other servants began to murmur again, saying, ""Look, now he is even burning up the king's wedding shirt."""		
A3166	Faithful Johannes was watchful and looked into her face		
A3167	Suddenly she turned pale and fell to the ground as if she were dead		
A3168	He ran quickly to her, picked her up and carried her into a chamber. He laid her down, then knelt and sucked three drops of blood from her right breast, and spat them out. Immediately she breathed again and regained consciousness		
A3169	". The young king saw what had happened, and not knowing why faithful Johannes had done it, grew angry and shouted, ""Throw him into prison."""		
A3170	faithful Johannes		
A3171	Everyone who is condemned to die is permitted before his end to say one last thing. May I too have this right?		
A3172	was condemned and led to the gallows.		
A3173	"""Yes,"" answered the king. ""You are granted this right."""		
A3174	"Then the king cried, ""Oh, my most faithful Johannes, pardon! Pardon! Bring him down."""		
A3175	But as faithful Johannes spoke the last word, he fell down lifeless and turned to stone.		
A3176	This caused the king and the queen great grief		
A3177	I have rewarded him very badly for his great loyalty.		
A3178	"He then ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom next to his bed. Every time that he looked at it he wept, saying, ""Oh, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes."		
A3179	"Once when the queen was at church and the two children were sitting beside their father and playing, he again looked sadly at the stone statue and said, ""Oh, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes."""		
A3180	, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes.		
A3181	"Then the stone began to speak and said, ""You can bring me back to life again if you will in return give up what is dearest to you."" The king cried, ""For you I will give up everything I have in the world."" The stone continued, ""If you will cut off the heads of your two children with your own hand, then sprinkle their blood on me, I shall be restored to life."""		
A3182	"The king cried, ""For you I will give up everything I have in the world."		
A3183	The king was horrified when he heard that he would have to kill his own dearest children, but he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty, and how he had died for him, then drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children's heads. And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, it returned to life, and faithful Johannes stood before him, again healthy and well.		
A3184	and jumped about and went on playing as if nothing had happened		
A3185	"When he saw the queen coming he hid faithful Johannes and the two children in a large chest. When she entered, he said to her, ""Have you been praying in the church?"" ""Yes, she answered, ""but I have constantly been thinking about faithful Johannes and what misfortune has befallen him because of us."""		
A3186	"""but I have constantly been thinking about faithful Johannes and what misfortune has befallen him because of us."""		
A3187	"Then he said, ""Dear wife, we can give him his life again, but it will cost us our two little sons. We will have to sacrifice them."""		
A3188	"""We owe it to him for his great loyalty."		
A3189	", ""God be praised!"		
A3190	Faithful Johannes has been saved, and we have our little sons again as well.		
A3191	Faithful Johannes has been saved,		
A3192	He told her how everything had happened		
A3193	have been unjustly condemned, and have always been loyal to you,		
A3194	"""If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow."" And as she said that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen."		
A3195	". ""If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow."" And as she said that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen"		
A3196	she stood beneath the juniper tree, which smelled so sweet that her heart jumped for joy, and she fell on her knees and was beside herself. And when the sixth month was over, the fruit was thick and large, and then she was quite still. And after the seventh month she picked the juniper berries and ate them greedily. Then she grew sick and sorrowful.		
A3197	she was quite comforted and happy until the next month was over, and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she saw it, she was so happy that she died. Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree, and he began to cry bitterly.		
A3198	"""Mother, give me an apple."""		
A3199	"""is brother not to have one too?"		
A3200	"""is brother not to have one too?"" This made the woman angry"		
A3201	kindly,		
A3202	"Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, ""My son, do you want an apple?"" And she looked at him fiercely. ""Mother,"" said the little boy, ""how angry you look. Yes, give me an apple."""		
A3203	"""Come with me,"" she said, opening the lid of the chest. ""Take out an apple for yourself."""		
A3204	"""Come with me,"" she said, opening the lid of the chest. ""Take out an apple for yourself."" And while the little boy was leaning over, the Evil One prompted her, and crash! she slammed down the lid, and his head flew off, falling among the red apples."		
A3205	"""brother is sitting at the door, and he looks totally white and has an apple in his hand. I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was very frightened."" ""Go back to him,"" said her mother, ""and if he will not answer you, then box his ears."""		
A3206	there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other dearly		
A3207	pious wife		
A3208	the woman prayed for them day and night		
A3209	"She sighed heavily, looked at the blood before her, and was most unhappy. ""If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow."" And as she said that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen."		
A3210	"""Go back to him,"" said her mother, ""and if he will not answer you, then box his ears."""		
A3211	"""If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper tree."		
A3212	"she called her husband to her, and cried, and said, ""If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper tree."""		
A3213	"Then she grew sick and sorrowful. Then the eighth month passed, and she called her husband to her, and cried, and said, ""If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper tree."" Then she was quite comforted and happy until the next month was over, and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she saw it, she was so happy that she died."		
A3214	Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree, and he began to cry bitterly. After some time he was more at ease, and although he still cried, he could bear it.		
A3215	And some time later he took another wife.		
A3216	When the woman looked at her daughter, she loved her very much		
A3217	When the woman looked at her daughter, she loved her very much, but then she looked at the little boy, and it pierced her heart, for she thought that he would always stand in her way, and she was always thinking how she could get the entire inheritance for her daughter.

A3219	And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there w		
A3220	she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace.		
A3221	"""Yes, my child,"" said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest."		
A3222	and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest		
A3223	gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest		
A3224	"""is brother not to have one too"		
A3225	"angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school"		
A3226	"When from the window she saw him coming, it was as though the Evil One came over her, and she grabbed the apple and took it away from her daughter, saying, ""You shall not have one before your brother."""		
A3227	"she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, ""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted."		
A3228	"""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted. ""Marlene,"" said the mother, ""what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it. It cannot be helped now. We will cook him into stew."""		
A3229	Marlene stood by crying and crying		
A3230	"""Here is the golden chain for you. Now sing that song again for me."		
A3231	", ""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" ""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."""

A3233	"""Oh, I feel so truly happy, and the sun is shining so beautifully outside. I feel as if I were about to see some old acquaintance again."" ""Not I,"" said the woman, ""I am so afraid that my teeth are chattering, and I feel like I have fire in my veins."" And she tore open her bodice even more. Marlene sat in a corner crying. She held a handkerchief before her eyes and cried until it was wet clear through."		
A3234	With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully		
A3235	"""Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks."""

A3244	So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white scarf out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen		
A3245	"""Mother,"" said Marlene, ""brother is sitting at the door, and he looks totally white and has an apple in his hand. I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was very frightened."""

It seems to me as if it were all mine."" And he ate and ate, throwing all the bones under the table, until he had finished it all."		
A3254	She laid them down beneath the juniper tree on the green grass, and after she had put them there, she suddenly felt better and did not cry anymore.		
A3255	Marlene, however, was as happy and contented as if her brother were still alive. And she went merrily into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.

A3263	"My mother killed me. ""I wish I were a thousand fathoms beneath the earth, so I would not have to hear that!"" My father, he ate me, Then the woman fell down as if she were dead. My sister Marlene, ""Oh,"" said Marlene, ""I too will go out and see if the bird will give me something."" Then she went out. Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, He threw the shoes down to her. Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I."		
A3264	"No,"" said the woman, jumping to her feet and with her hair standing up like flames of fire, ""I feel as if the world were coming to an end. I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better."" And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death."		
A3265	Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.

A3267	they loved each other dearly		
A3268	Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree		
A3269	he took another wife.		
A3270	she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him		
A3271	gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest.		
A3272	"""is brother not to have one too?"""		
A3273	set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen		
A3274	"""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"""		
A3275	Marlene, however, was as happy and contented as if her brother were still alive.		
A3276	My mother, she killed me,		
A3277	My father, he ate me,		
A3278	My sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree,

A3283	Here is the golden chain for you.		
A3284	"""how beautifully you can sing."""		
A3285	"""There, bird,"""		
A3286	We will cook him into stew.		
A3287	"""Mother,"" said the little boy, ""how angry you look. Yes, give me an apple"		
A3288	took a beam and lifted the stone up		
A3289	My sister Marlene,

A3294	"I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better."""		
A3295	I feel as if the world were coming to an end.		
A3296	My mother killed me.		
A3297	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf,		
A3298	Laid them beneath the juniper tree,		
A3299	"""You shall not have one before your brother."""		
A3300	aid that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen.		
A3301	"""If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood in this frame."""		
A3302	She was a beautiful woman, but she was proud and arrogant, and she could not stand it if anyone might surpass her in beauty.		
A3303	Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I will run into the wild woods and never come back.		
A3304	Just then a young boar came running by. He killed it, cut out its lungs and liver, and took them back to the queen as proof of Snow-White's death. The cook had to boil them with salt, and the wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver.		
A3305	the wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver. The poor child was now all alone in the great forest, and she was so afraid that she just looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do.		
A3306	The cook had to boil them with salt, and the wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver. The poor child was now all alone in the great forest, and she was so afraid that she just looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do.		
A3307	There was a little table with a white tablecloth and seven little plates, and each plate had a spoon, and there were seven knives and forks and seven mugs as well. Against the wall there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with snow-white sheets.		
A3308	Then she told them that her stepmother had tried to kill her, that the huntsman had spared her life,		
A3309	", ""If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want."""		
A3310	"""I can let that honest woman in,"		
A3311	"""I can let that honest woman in,"" thought Snow-White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty bodice lace. ""Child,"" said the old woman, ""how you look! Come, let me lace you up properly."" The unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and let her do up the new lace, but the old woman pulled so quickly and so hard that Snow-White could not breathe."		
A3312	. Then she disguised herself, taking the form of a different old woman.		
A3313	"""Go on your way. I am not allowed to let anyone in."" ""You surely may take a look,"" said the old woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it up. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door."		
A3314	"""You specimen of beauty,"" said the wicked woman, ""now you are finished."" And she walked away. Fortunately it was almost evening, and the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw Snow-White lying on the ground as if she were dead, they immediately suspected her stepmother. They examined her and found the poisoned comb. They had scarcely pulled it out when Snow-White came to herself again and told them what had happened."		
A3315	". ""Look, I'll cut the apple in two. You eat the red half, and I shall eat the white half."" Now the apple had been so artfully made that only the red half was poisoned. Snow-White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the peasant woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half. She barely had a bite in her mouth when she fell to the ground dead."		
A3316	The dear child was dead, and she remained dead. They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days.		
A3317	Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain, and one of them always stayed with it and watched over her.		
A3318	Snow-White lay there in the coffin a long, long time, and she did not decay, but looked like she was asleep, for she was still as white as snow and as red as blood, and as black-haired as ebony wood		
A3319	"""We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."""		
A3320	", ""Let me have the coffin. I will give you anything you want for it."" But the dwarfs answered, ""We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."""		
A3321	the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him the coffin.		
A3322	but let her continue to sleep there in the bed		
A3323	The unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and let her do up the new lace		
A3324	". I will honor her and respect her as my most cherished one."""		
A3325	So she kept house for them. Every morning they went into the mountains looking for ore and gold, and in the evening when they came back home their meal had to be ready.		
A3326	"""If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want"		
A3327	And as soon as the child was born, the queen died.		
A3328	She was a beautiful woman, but she was proud and arrogant, and she could not stand it if anyone might surpass her in beauty. She had a magic mirror.		
A3329	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? To this the mirror answered: You, my queen, are fairest of all.		
A3330	for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.		
A3331	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? It answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3332	One day when the queen asked her mirror: Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? It answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3333	The queen took fright and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour on whenever she looked at Snow-White her heart turned over inside her body, so great was her hatred for the girl. The envy and pride grew ever greater, like a weed in her heart, until she had no peace day and night.		
A3334	until she had no peace day and night.		
A3335	"Then she summoned a huntsman and said to him, ""Take Snow-White out into the woods. I never want to see her again. Kill her, and as proof that she is dead bring her lungs and her liver back to me."" The huntsman obeyed and took Snow-White into the woods. He took out his hunting knife and was about to stab it into her innocent heart when she began to cry, saying, ""Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I will run into the wild woods and never come back."" Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her, and he said, ""Run away, you poor child."""		
A3336	"The huntsman obeyed and took Snow-White into the woods. He took out his hunting knife and was about to stab it into her innocent heart when she began to cry, saying, ""Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I will run into the wild woods and never come back."""		
A3337	"He thought, ""The wild animals will soon devour you anyway,"" but still it was as if a stone had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her."		
A3338	The poor child was now all alone in the great forest, and she was so afraid that she just looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do		
A3339	Because she was so hungry and thirsty Snow-White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate, and from each mug she drank a drop of wine.		
A3340	She remained lying in it, entrusted herself to God, and fell asleep.		
A3341	Soon afterward she had a little daughter who was as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood, and therefore they called her Little Snow-White		
A3342	They were so happy, that they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed		
A3343	"The next morning Snow-White woke up, and when she saw the seven dwarfs she was frightened. But they were friendly and asked, ""What is your name?"" ""My name is Snow-White,"" she answered."		
A3344	Now the queen, believing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver, could only think that she was again the first and the most beautiful woman of all.		
A3345	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? It answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3346	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3347	This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie		
A3348	as long as she was not the most beautiful woman in the entire land her envy would give her no rest		
A3349	At last she thought of something. Coloring her face, she disguised herself as an old peddler woman, so that no one would recognize her.		
A3350	The unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and let her do up the new lace, but the old woman pulled so quickly and so hard that Snow-White could not breathe.		
A3351	The mirror answered once again: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3352	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? The mirror answered once again: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3353	When she heard that, all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow-White had come back to life.		
A3354	Then with the art of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisoned comb. Then she disguised herself, taking the form of a different old woman.		
A3355	"Snow-White looked out and said, ""Go on your way. I am not allowed to let anyone in."" ""You surely may take a look,"" said the old woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it up. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door."		
A3356	The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door.		
A3357	After they had agreed on the purchase		
A3358	The mirror answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3359	Then she went into her most secret room -- no one else was allowed inside --		
A3360	coloring her face, she disguised herself as a peasant woman		
A3361	"""Are you afraid of poison?"" asked the old woman. ""Look, I'll cut the apple in two. You eat the red half, and I shall eat the white half."""		
A3362	"""No,"" said Snow-White, ""I cannot accept anything."" ""Are you afraid of poison?"" asked the old woman. ""Look, I'll cut the apple in two. You eat the red half, and I shall eat the white half."" Now the apple had been so artfully made that only the red half was poisoned. Snow-White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the peasant woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half."		
A3363	"The queen looked at her with a gruesome stare, laughed loudly, and said, ""White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony wood! This time the dwarfs cannot awaken you."""		
A3364	Then her envious heart was at rest, as well as an envious heart can be at rest.		
A3365	They were going to bury her, but she still looked as fresh as a living person, and still had her beautiful red cheeks.		
A3366	"They said, ""We cannot bury her in the black earth,"" and they had a transparent glass coffin made, so she could be seen from all sides."		
A3367	"Then he said to the dwarfs, ""Let me have the coffin. I will give you anything you want for it."""		
A3368	"But the dwarfs answered, ""We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."""		
A3369	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? The mirror answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But the young queen is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3370	The mirror answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But the young queen is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3371	but she found no peace		
A3372	She had to go and see the young queen		
A3373	When she arrived she recognized Snow-White, and terrorized, she could only stand there without moving		
A3374	"As she was thus lamenting, someone called out to her, ""What is the matter with you, princess? Your crying would turn a stone to pity."""		
A3375	"""Oh, it's you, old water-splasher,"" she said. ""I am crying because my golden ball has fallen into the well."		
A3376	"""Be still and stop crying,"" answered the frog. I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring back your plaything?"""		
A3377	"""Whatever you want, dear frog,"" she said, ""my clothes, my pearls and precious stones, and even the golden crown that I am wearing."""		
A3378	my clothes, my pearls and precious stones, and even the golden crown that I am wearing.		
A3379	"he frog answered, ""I do not want your clothes, your pearls and precious stones, nor your golden crown, but if you will love me and accept me as a companion and playmate, and let me sit next to you at your table and eat from your golden plate and drink from your cup and sleep in your bed, if you will promise this to me, then I'll dive down and bring your golden ball back to you."" ""Oh, yes,"" she said, ""I promise all of that to you if you will just bring the ball back to me."" But she thought, ""What is this stupid frog trying to say? He just sits here in the water with his own kind and croaks. He cannot be a companion to a human."""		
A3380	"""Oh, yes,"" she said, ""I promise all of that to you if you will just bring the ball back to me."" But she thought, ""What is this stupid frog trying to say? He just sits here in the water with his own kind and croaks. He cannot be a companion to a human."""		
A3381	"As soon as the frog heard her say ""yes"" he stuck his head under and dove to the bottom. He paddled back up a short time later with the golden ball in his mouth and threw it onto the grass. The princess was filled with joy when she saw her beautiful plaything once again, picked it up, and ran off. ""Wait, wait,"" called the frog, ""take me along. I cannot run as fast as you."" But what did it help him, that he croaked out after her as loudly as he could? She paid no attention to him, but instead hurried home and soon forgot the poor frog, who had to return again to his well."		
A3382	"""Wait, wait,"" called the frog, ""take me along. I cannot run as fast as you."" But what did it help him, that he croaked out after her as loudly as he could? She paid no attention to him, but instead hurried home and soon forgot the poor frog, who had to return again to his well."		
A3383	"Oh, father dear, yesterday when I was sitting near the well in the forest and playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I was crying so much, the frog brought it back, and because he insisted, I promised him that he could be my companion, but I didn't think that he could leave his water. But now he is just outside the door and wants to come in."""

A3386	"The king said, ""What you have promised, you must keep. Go and let the frog in."""		
A3387	What you have promised, you must keep.		
A3388	She hesitated, until finally the king commanded her to do it.		
A3389	the king commanded her to do it.		
A3390	"The princess began to cry and was afraid of the cold frog and did not dare to even touch him, and yet he was supposed to sleep in her beautiful, clean bed. The king became angry and said, ""You should not despise someone who has helped you in time of need."" She picked him up with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and set him in a corner. As she was lying in bed, he came creeping up to her and said, ""I am tired, and I want to sleep as well as you do. Pick me up or I'll tell your father."""		
A3391	"""You should not despise someone who has helped you in time of need."""		
A3392	"Pick me up or I'll tell your father."" With that she became bitterly angry and threw him against the wall with all her might. ""Now you will have your peace, you disgusting frog!"""

A3422	it was the bands springing from faithful Heinrich's heart because his master was now redeemed and happy.		
A3423	To pass the time she would take a golden ball, throw it into the air, and then catch it. It was her favorite plaything. Now one day it happened that the princess's golden ball did not fall into her hands, that she held up high, but instead it fell to the ground and rolled right into the water. The princess followed it with her eyes, but the ball disappeared, and the well was so deep that she could not see its bottom. Then she began to cry. She cried louder and louder, and she could not console herself.		
A3424	"I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring back your plaything?"" ""Whatever you want, dear frog,"" she said, ""my clothes, my pearls and precious stones, and even the golden crown that I am wearing."""

A3429	The frog enjoyed his meal, but for her every bite stuck in her throat.

A3433	But when he fell down, he was not a frog, but a prince with beautiful friendly eyes.		
A3434	At the rear stood the young king's servant, faithful Heinrich.		
A3435	Faithful Heinrich lifted them both inside and took his place at the rear. He was filled with joy over the redemption.		
A3436	"After they had gone a short distance, the prince heard a crack from behind, as though something had broken. He turned around and said, ""Heinrich, the carriage is breaking apart."" No, my lord, the carriage it's not, But one of the bands surrounding my heart"

A3438	The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, are governed by the same laws with the motions of the planets, and can by no means be accounted for by the hypothesis of vortices; for comets are carried with very eccentric motions through all parts of the heavens indifferently, with a freedom that is incompatible with the notion of a vortex.

A3442	The six primary planets are revolved about the sun in circles concentric with the sun, and with motions directed towards the same parts, and almost in the same plane. Ten moons are revolved about the earth, Jupiter and Saturn, in circles concentric with them, with the same direction of motion, and nearly in the planes of the orbits of those planets;		
A3443	This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the centres of other like systems, these, being formed by the like wise counsel, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all the other systems: and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their gravity, fall on each other mutually, he hath placed those systems at immense distances one from another.		
A3444	This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called Lord God παντοκράτωρ, or Universal Ruler; for God is a relative word, and has a respect to servants; and Deity is the dominion of God not over his own body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of the world, but over servants.

A3448	He is utterly void of all body and bodily figure, and can therefore neither be seen, nor heard, nor touched; nor ought he to be worshipped under the representation of any corporeal thing. We have ideas of his attributes, but what the real substance of any thing is we know not.		
A3449	We know him only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of things, and final causes: we admire him for his perfections;		
A3450	we reverence and adore him on account of his dominion: for we adore him as his servants; and a god without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature.		
A3451	a god without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature.		
A3452	All that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different times and places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of a Being necessarily existing. But, by way of allegory, God is said to see, to speak, to laugh, to love, to hate, to desire, to give, to receive, to rejoice, to be angry, to fight, to frame, to work, to build; for all our notions of God are taken from the ways of mankind by a certain similitude, which, though not perfect, has some likeness, however. And thus much concerning God; to discourse of whom from the appearances of things, does certainly belong to Natural Philosophy.		
A3453	But hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phænomena, and I frame no hypotheses; for whatever is not deduced from the phænomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.		
A3454	I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phænomena, and I frame no hypotheses;		
A3455	In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.		
A3456	But these are things that cannot be explained in few words, nor are we furnished with that sufficiency of experiments which is required to an accurate determination and demonstration of the laws by which this electric and elastic Spirit operates.		
A3457	nor are we furnished with that sufficiency of experiments which is required to an accurate determination and demonstration of the laws		
A3458	but the rotation of the sun and planets about their axes, which ought to correspond with the motions of their vortices, recede far from all these proportions.		
A3459	The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, are governed by the same laws with the motions of the planets, and can by no means be accounted for by the hypothesis of vortices		
A3460	We know him only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of things, and final causes		
A3461	We have ideas of his attributes, but what the real substance of any thing is we know not. In bodies, we see only their figures and colours, we hear only the sounds, we touch only their outward surfaces, we smell only the smells, and taste the savours; but their inward substances are not to be known either by our senses, or by any reflex act of our minds: much less, then, have we any idea of the substance of God. We know him only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of things, and final causes		
A3462	But hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phænomena		
A3463	Since the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things; and the moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeavoured to subject the phænomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards philosophy.		
A3464	Since the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things		
A3465	The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect; as rational, which proceeds accurately by demonstration:		
A3466	To practical mechanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.		
A3467	But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accurate is called geometrical, what is less so, is called mechanical.		
A3468	He that works with less accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work with perfect accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all; for the description if right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to mechanics.		
A3469	To describe right lines and circles are problems, but not geometrical problems. The solution of these problems is required from mechanics; and by geometry the use of them, when so solved, is shown; and it is the glory of geometry that from those few principles, brought from without, it is able to produce so many things.		
A3470	In this sense rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any motions, accurately proposed and demonstrated.		
A3471	we consider chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the resistance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles if philosophy; for all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this—from the phænomena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phænomena; and to this end the general propositions in the first and second book are directed		
A3472	by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the former books, we in the third derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets.		
A3473	hope the principles here laid down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of philosophy.		
A3474	In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that its becoming public is owing; for when he had obtained of me my demonstrations of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to communicate the same to the Royal Society, who afterwards, by their kind encouragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them.		
A3475	I heartily beg that what I have here done may be read with candour; and that the defects in a subject so difficult be not so much reprehended as kindly supplied, and investigated by new endeavours of my readers.		
A3476	he moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeavoured to subject the phænomena of nature to the laws of mathematics,		
A3477	geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is nothing but that part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes and demonstrates the art of measuring		
A3478	rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any motions, accurately proposed and demonstrated.		
A3479	This part of mechanics was cultivated by the ancients in the five powers which relate to manual arts, who considered gravity (it not being a manual power), no otherwise than as it moved weights by those powers. Our design not respecting arts, but philosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the resistance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles if philosophy		
A3480	I hope the principles here laid down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of philosophy		
A3481	In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the press and taking care of the schemes		
A3482	I bewail the fortunes of this house of ours, not ordered for the best as in days gone by.		
A3483	And I implore Paean7, the healer, that she may not raise adverse gales with long delay to stay the Danaan fleet from putting forth,by urging another sacrifice, one that knows no law, unsuited for feast, worker of family strife, dissolving wife's reverence for husband.  For there abides wrath—terrible, not to be suppressed, a treacherous guardian of the home, a wrath that never forgets and that exacts vengeance for a child.”		
A3484	For thus commands my queen, woman in passionate heart and man in strength of purpose.		
A3485	Zeus, who sets mortals on the path to understanding, Zeus, who has established as a fixed law that “wisdom comes by suffering.”  But even as trouble, bringing memory of pain, drips over the mind in sleep,so wisdom comes to men, whether they want it or not. Harsh, it seems to me, is the grace of gods enthroned upon their awful seats.		
A3486	“It is a hard fate to refuse obedience, and hard, if I must slay my child, the glory of my home, and at the altar-side staina father's hand with streams of virgin's blood.  Which of these courses is not filled with evil?  How can I become a deserter to my fleet and fail my allies in arms?For that they should with all too impassioned passion crave a sacrifice to lull the winds—even a virgin's blood—stands within their right.  May all be for the best.”		
A3487	But when he had donned the yoke of Necessity, with veering of mind,impious, unholy, unsanctified, from that moment he changed his intention and began to conceive that deed of uttermost audacity.  For wretched delusion, counsellor of ill, primal source of woe, makes mortals bold. So then he hardened his heart to sacrifice his daughterso that he might further a war waged to avenge a woman, and as an offering for the voyage of a fleet!		
A3488	for it is fitting to do homage to the consort of a sovereign princewhen her husband's throne is empty.		
A3489	but may the good prevail clearly for all to see!For, choosing thus, I have chosen the enjoyment of many a blessing.		
A3490	These are my woman's words;		
A3491	Lady, you speak as wisely as a prudent man.		
A3492	For riches do not protect the man who in wantonness has kicked the mighty altar of Justice into obscurity.		
A3493	Perverse Temptation, the overmastering child of designing Destruction, drives men on; and every remedy is futile.  His evil is not hidden; it shines forth, a baleful gleam.Like base metal beneath the touchstone's rub, when tested he shows the blackness of his grain （for he is like a child who chases a winged bird）and upon his people he brings a taint against which there is no defence.  No god listens to his prayers. The man associated with such deeds, him they destroy in his unrighteousness. And such was Paris, who cameto the house of the sons of Atreus and dishonoured the hospitality of his host by stealing away a wedded wife.		
A3494	Ares barters the bodies of men for gold; he holds his balance in the contest of the spear; andback from Ilium to their loved ones he sends a heavy dust passed through his burning, a dust cried over with plenteous tears, in place of men sending well made urns with ashes.So they lament, praising now this one:  “How skilled in battle!”  now that one:  “Fallen nobly in the carnage,”—“for another's wife—” some mutter in secret, andgrief charged with resentment spreads stealthily against the sons of Atreus, champions in the strife.  But there far from home, around the city's walls, those in their beauty's bloom have graves in Ilium—the enemy's soil has covered its conquerors.		
A3495	The gods are not blind to men with blood upon their hands.  In the end the black Spirits of Vengeance bring to obscurity that one who has prospered in unrighteousness andwear down his fortunes by reverse. Once a man is among the unseen, there is no more help for him.		
A3496	Glory in excess is fraught with peril;the lofty peak is struck by Zeus' thunderbolt.  I choose prosperity unassailed by envy.  May I not be a sacker of cities, and may I not myself be despoiled and live to see my own life in another's power!		
A3497	It is just like a woman's eager nature to yield assent to pleasing news before yet the truth is clear.		
A3498	Too credulous, a woman's mind has boundaries open to quick encroachment; but quick to perish is rumor spread by a woman.		
A3499	Convicted for robbery and for theft as well,he has lost the plunder and has razed in utter destruction his father's house and even the land.  The sons of Priam have paid a twofold penalty for their sins.		
A3500	Then there were some who chided me and said: “Are you so convinced by beacon-fires as to think that Troy has now been sacked?  Truly, it is just like a woman to be elated in heart.”		
A3501	Nevertheless I still held on with my sacrifice, and throughout all the quarters of the city, according to their womanly custom,they raised a shout of happy praise while in the shrines of the gods they lulled to rest the fragrant spice-fed flame. So now why should you rehearse to me the account at length?  From the king himself I shall hear the whole tale;but I should hasten to welcome my honored husband best on his return. For what joy is sweeter in a woman's eyes than to unbar the gates for her husband when God has spared him to return from war? Give this message to my husband:let him come with all speed, his country's fond desire, come to find at home his wife faithful, even as he left her, a watchdog of his house, loyal to him, a foe to those who wish him ill; yes, for the rest, unchanged in every part;in all this length of time never having broken any seal.  Of pleasure from any other man or of scandalous repute I know no more than of dyeing bronze.		
A3502	A boast like this, loaded full with truth, does not shame the speech of a noble wife.		
A3503	But Priam's city has learned, in her old age, an altered strain, and now, I trust, wails a loud song, full of lamentation, calling Paris “evil-wed”; for she has born the burden of a life in which everything was destroyed, a life full of lamentation because ofthe wretched slaughter of her sons		
A3504	Even so a man reared in his house a lion's whelp, robbed of its mother's milk yet still desiring the breast.  Gentle it wasin the prelude of its life, kindly to children, and a delight to the old.  Much did it get, held in arms like a nursling child, with itsbright eye turned toward his hand, and fawning under compulsion of its belly's need. Chorus But brought to full growth by time it showed the nature it had from its parents.  Unbidden, as payment for its fostering,it prepared a feast with ruinous slaughter of the flocks; so that the house was defiled with blood, and whose who lived there could not control their anguish, and great was the carnage far and wide.A priest of ruin, by order of a god, it was reared in the house.		
A3505	but when a house is righteous, the lot of its children is blessed always.		
A3506	But Righteousness shines in smoke-begrimed dwellingsand esteems the virtuous man. From gilded mansions, where men's hands are foul, she departs with averted eyes and makes her way to pure homes; she does not worship the powerof wealth stamped counterfeit by the praise of men, and she guides all things to their proper end.		
A3507	For this success we should render to the gods a return in ever-mindful gratitude, seeing that we have thrown round the city the toils of vengeance, and in a woman's cause it has been laid low by the fierce Argive beast,brood of the horse,23a shield-armed folk, that launched its leap when the Pleiades waned.		
A3508	First and foremost, it is a terrible evil for a wife to sit forlorn at home, severed from her husband, always hearing many malignant rumors, and for one messenger after anotherto come bearing tidings of disaster, each worse than the last, and cry them to the household.		
A3509	Why this loitering, women, to whom I have assigned the task to strew with tapestries the place where he shall go?Quick!  With purple let his path be strewn, that Justice may usher him into a home he never hoped to see.		
A3510	For the rest, pamper me not as if I were a woman, nor, like some barbarian,27grovel before me with widemouthed acclaim;		
A3511	It is the gods we must honor thus; but it is not possible for a mortal to tread upon embroidered fineries without fear.I tell you to revere me not as a god, but as a man.		
A3512	Surely it is not woman's part to long for fighting.		
A3513	This foreign girl receive into the house with kindness.  A god from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master; for no one freely takes the yoke of slavery.  But she,the choicest flower of rich treasure, has followed in my train, my army's gift.		
A3514	Get inside, you too, Cassandra34; since not unkindly has Zeus appointed you to share the holy water of a house where you may take your stand, with many another slave, at the altar of the god who guards its wealth.  Get down from the car and do not be too proud;for even Alcmene's son35, men say, once endured to be sold and eat the bread of slavery.  But if such fortune should of necessity fall to the lot of any, there is good cause for thankfulness in having masters of ancient wealth; for they who, beyond their hope, have reaped a rich harvest of possessions,are cruel to their slaves in every way, even exceeding due measure.  You have from us such usage as custom warrants.		
A3515	Yet once more I would like to speak, but not a dirge.  I pray to the sun, in presence of his latest light, that my enemies45may at the same time pay to my avengers a bloody penalty forslaughtering a slave, an easy prey.  Alas for human fortune!  When prosperous, a mere shadow can overturn it46; if misfortune strikes, the dash of a wet sponge blots out the drawing.And this last I deem far more pitiable than that.		
A3516	It is plain.  Their opening actmarks a plan to set up a tyranny in the State.		
A3517	No, death would be better,for that would be a milder lot than tyranny.		
A3518	We are shocked at your tongue, how bold-mouthed you are,that over your husband you can utter such a boastful speech.		
A3519	You are testing me as if I were a witless woman.		
A3520	Is it not he whom you should have banished from this landin requital for his polluting deed?  No!  When you arraign what I have done, you are a stern judge.  Well, I warn you: threaten me thus on the understanding that I am prepared, conditions equal, to let you lord it over me if you shall vanquish me by force.  But if a god shall bring the contrary to pass,you shall learn discretion though taught the lesson late.		
A3521	Bereft of all honor, forsaken of your friends,you shall hereafter atone for stroke with stroke,		
A3522	by Justice, exacted for my child, by Ate, by the Avenging Spirit, to whom I sacrificed that man, hope does not tread for me the halls of fear,so long as the fire upon my hearth is kindled by Aegisthus, loyal in heart to me as in days gone by.  For he is no slight shield of confidence to me. Here lies the man who did me wrong, plaything of each Chryseis at Ilium;and here she lies, his captive, and auguress, and concubine, his oracular faithful whore, yet equally familiar with the seamen's benches.  The pair has met no undeserved fate.  For he lies thus; while she, who, like a swan,has sung her last lament in death, lies here, his beloved; but to me she has brought for my bed an added relish of delight.		
A3523	who in a woman's cause had much endured and by a woman's hand has lost his life.		
A3524	The spoiler is despoiled, the slayer pays penalty.		
A3525	Hail gracious light of the day of retribution!  At last the hour has come when I can say that the gods who avenge mortal men look down from on high upon the crimes of earth.Now that, to my joy, I behold this man lying here in a robe spun by the Avenging Spirits and making full payment for the deeds contrived in craft by his father's hand.		
A3526	I tell you in the hour of justice that you yourself, be sure of that, will not escape the people's curses and death by stoning at their hand.		
A3527	Ha!  I will visit you with vengeance yet in days to come.		
A3528	It would not be like men of Argos to cringe before a man as low as you.		
A3529	Sure enough, for your eye betrays your loyal heart.		
A3530	And there, with judges of your case and speeches of persuasive charm, we shall find means to release you completely from your labors.		
A3531	truly Zeus respects this right of outlaws		
A3532	It is due to you that I am thus dishonored among the other dead;because of those I killed the dead never cease to reproach me, and I wander in disgrace.		
A3533	although you are a god, you have stolen away a man that killed his mother. What is there here that anyone shall call just?		
A3534	They do such things, the younger gods, who rule, wholly beyond justice,		
A3535	avenger		
A3536	I directed him to exact vengeance for his father.		
A3537	For marriage ordained by fate for a man and a woman is greater than an oath and guarded by Justice		
A3538	But the goddess Pallas will oversee the pleadings in this case.		
A3539	For the wrath of the one who seeks purification is terrible among mortals and gods		
A3540	And I will aid my suppliant and rescue him!		
A3541	Here I will keep watch and await the result of my trial.		
A3542	with his debt unpaid!		
A3543	so that you pay atonement for your murdered mother's agony.		
A3544	each having a just punishment.		
A3545	We claim to be just and upright.		
A3546	but whoever sins, as this man has, and hides his blood-stained hands, as avengers of bloodshed we appear against him to the end, presenting ourselves as upright witnesses for the dead.		
A3547	Right		
A3548	Two parties are present; only half the case is heard.		
A3549	You want to be called just rather than to act justly.		
A3550	I say that oaths must not win victory for injustice.		
A3551	relying on the justice of your case		
A3552	And when I came back home, having been an exile in the time before, I killed the woman who gave birth to me, I will not deny it, as the penalty in return for the murder of my dearly-loved father.		
A3553	You judge whether I acted justly or not		
A3554	The matter is too great, if any mortal thinks to pass judgment on it		
A3555	I will select judges of homicide bound by oath, and I will establish this tribunal for all time.		
A3556	Summon your witnesses and proofs, sworn evidence to support your case; and I will return when I have chosen the best of my citizens, for them to decide this matter truly, after they take an oath that they will pronounce no judgment contrary to justice.		
A3557	arrogance is truly the child of impiety		
A3558	respect the altar of Justice and do not, looking to profit, dishonor it by spurning with godless foot		
A3559	or punishment will come upon you.		
A3560	He wrecks the happiness of his earlier life on the reef of Justice, and he perishes unwept, unseen.		
A3561	just or not		
A3562	Learn how strong this plea of justice is		
A3563	Yes, for it is not the same thing—the murder of a noble man,honored by a god-given scepter, and his murder indeed by a woman,		
A3564	The mother of what is called her child is not the parent, but the nurse of the newly-sown embryo.24 The one who mounts is the parent, whereas she, as a stranger for a stranger,preserves the young plant, if the god does not harm it.  And I will show you proof of what I say: a father might exist without a mother. A witness is here at hand, the child of Olympian Zeus, who was not nursed in the darkness of a womb,and she is such a child as no goddess could give birth to.		
A3565	as you judge the first trial		
A3566	In the future, even as now, this court of judges will always exist for the people of Aegeus. And this Hill of Ares, the seat and camp of the Amazons,when they came with an army in resentment against Theseus, and in those days built up this new citadel with lofty towers to rival his, and sacrificed to Ares, from which this rock takes its name, the Hill of Ares:25on this hill, the reverence of the citizens, and fear, its kinsman, will hold them back from doing wrong by day and night alike, so long as they themselves do not pollute the laws with evil streams; if you stain clear water with filth, you will never find a drink.		
A3567	Neither anarchy nor tyranny		
A3568	I establish this tribunal, untouched by greed, worthy of reverence, quick to anger, awake on behalf of those who sleep, a guardian of the land.		
A3569	the numbers of the casts are equal		
A3570	For you have not been defeated; the trial resulted fairly in an equal vote, without disgrace to you		
A3571	just		
A3572	unjust		
A3573	justly		
A3574	Peace		
A3575	Oh grant me, Zeus, to avenge my father's death, and may you be my willing ally!		
A3576	cried out from the god that those beneath the earth cast furious reproachesand rage against their murderers.		
A3577	But the balance of Justice keeps watch:  swiftly it descends on those in the light; sometimes pain waits for those who linger on the frontier of twilight; and others are claimed by strengthless night.		
A3578	For since the gods laid constraining doom about my city and led me from my father's house to a slave's lot, it is fitting for me to govern my bitter hate, even against my will, and submit to the wishes of my masters, whether just or unjust.		
A3579	using your judgment		
A3580	judge		
A3581	How could it not be right to repay an enemy with ills?		
A3582	I ask that your avenger appear to our foes, father, and that your killers may be killed in just retribution.		
A3583	the love I bore my sister, victim of a pitiless sacrifice; and you were my faithful brother, bringing me your reverence.		
A3584	May Might and Justice, with Zeus, supreme over all, in the third place, lend you their aid!		
A3585	May I some day see them dead in the ooze of flaming pitch!		
A3586	if I do not take vengeance on my father's murderers.		
A3587	should not be subjected so to a pair of women.  For he has a woman's mind, or if not, it will soon be found out.		
A3588	“For a word of hate let a word of hate be said,”Justice cries out as she exacts the debt, “and for a murderous stroke let a murderous stroke be paid.”  “Let it be done to him as he does,” says the age-old wisdom.		
A3589	What of these things is good, what free of evil?		
A3590	Then you would have left a good name for your children in their halls, and in their maturity you would have made their lives admired by men.		
A3591	After injustice I demand justice as my right.		
A3592	And it is the eternal rule that drops of blood spilled on the ground demand yet more blood.Murder cries out on the Fury, which from those killed before brings one ruin in the wake of another.		
A3593	But you yourself be eager to resolve what is to follow.  You must enter the contest with inflexible wrath.		
A3594	Ares will encounter Ares; Right will encounter Right.		
A3595	O you gods, judge rightly the plea of right!		
A3596	But I honor the hearths of homes not heated by passion's fires, and in woman a spirit that shrinks from audacious deeds.		
A3597	For truly the injustice of him who has unjustly transgressed the sovereign majesty of Zeus lies on the ground trampled under foot.		
A3598	man speaks boldly to man and reveals his meaning without reserve.		
A3599	from man to man		
A3600	so that those who rightly desire the rule of order may behold it.		
A3601	Every word of mine has been uttered in justice.		
A3602	the radiant light of freedom.		
A3603	the song that women raise when the wind sits fair		
A3604	Or is it merely a panic-stricken report spread by womenwhich leaps up to die away in nothingness?		
A3605	I judge you victor:		
A3606	It is a grief for women to be deprived of a husband, my child.		
A3607	Yes, but it is the husband's toil that supports them while they sit at home.		
A3608	justice came at last in crushing retribution		
A3609	vengeance		
A3610	he has suffered the penalty prescribed for adulterers.		
A3611	May such a woman not live with me in my house!Before that may the gods grant me to perish childless!		
A3612	For there indeed are the hounds of wrath to avenge my mother.		
A3613	Oh when will it finish its work, when will the fury of calamity, lulled to rest, find an end and cease?		
A3614	But who can tell of man's overweening spirit,and of the reckless passions of women hardened of soul, partners of the woes of mortals?  Inordinate passion, overmastering the female, gains a fatal victory over the wedded unions of beasts and humans alike.		
A3615	Such is his offence; for this he is bound		
A3616	Such is the prize you have gained for your championship of man		
A3617	For, god though you are, you did not fear the wrath of the gods, butyou bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due.		
A3618	A strangely potent tie is kinship, and companionship as well.		
A3619	For it is because I bestowed good gifts on mortals that this miserable yoke of constraint has been bound upon me.  I hunted out and stored in fennel stalk the stolensource of fire that has proved a teacher to mortals in every art and a means to mighty ends.  Such is the offence for which I pay the penalty, riveted in fetters beneath the open sky.		
A3620	Alas, Prometheus, I groan for your sufferings.		
A3621	what shameful torture I am racked		
A3622	Behold me, an ill-fated god, chained,the foe of Zeus, hated of all who enter the court of Zeus, because of my very great love for mankind.		
A3623	For there are new rulers  in heaven, and Zeus governs withlawless customs; that which was mighty before he now brings to nothing.		
A3624	you give too much license to your tongue		
A3625	Then, calming down his stubborn wrath, he shall at last bond with me in union and friendship,as eager as I am to welcome him.		
A3626	for it is a disease that is somehow inherent in tyranny to have no faith in friends.		
A3627	I saved mortals so that they did not descend, blasted utterly, to the house of Hades.  This is why I am bent by such grievous tortures,painful to suffer, piteous to behold.		
A3628	I who gave mortals first place in my pity, I am deemed unworthy to win this pity for myself, but am in this way mercilessly disciplined, a spectacle that shames the glory of Zeus.		
A3629	For myself, I would not have desired to see them; and now that I see them, I am pained in my heart.		
A3630	Of my own will, yes, of my own will I erred—I will not deny it. By helping mortals I found suffering for myself;		
A3631	there is none to whom I should  pay greater respect than to you		
A3632	No, do not think it is from pride or even from wilfulness that I am silent.  Painful thoughts devour my heart as I behold myself maltreated in this way		
A3633	until I taught them to discern the risings of the stars and their settings, which are difficult to distinguish. Yes, and numbers, too, chiefest of sciences,I invented for them, and the combining of letters, creative mother of the Muses' arts, with which to hold all things in memory.  I, too, first brought brute beasts beneath the yoke to be subject to the collar and the pack-saddle, so that they might bear in men's stead theirheaviest burdens; and  to the chariot I harnessed horses and made them obedient to the rein, to be an image of wealth and luxury. It was I and no one else who invented the mariner's flaxen-winged car that roams the sea		
A3634	I showed them how to mix soothing remedies with which they now ward off all their disorders.  And I marked out many ways by which they might read the future,and among dreams I first discerned which are destined to come true; and voices baffling interpretation I explained to them, and signs from chance meetings.  The flight of crook-taloned birds I distinguished clearly— which by nature are auspicious,which sinister—their various modes of life,		
A3635	I cleared their vision to discern signs from flames,which were obscure before this		
A3636	Now as to the benefits to men that lay concealed beneath the earth—bronze, iron, silver, and gold—who would claim to have discovered them before me?		
A3637	every art possessed by man comes from Prometheus.		
A3638	in that even he cannot escape what is foretold.		
A3639	nor may I be slow to approach the gods, with holy sacrifices of oxen slain,		
A3640	But I shudderas I look on you, racked by infinite tortures.		
A3641	not weaving riddles, but in simple language, since it is right to speak openly to friends.		
A3642	a common benefactor of mankind, wretched Prometheus, why do you suffer so		
A3643	for I consider false words to be the foulest sickness.		
A3644	Does it not seem to you that the tyrant of the gods is violent in all his ways?  For this god, desirous of union with this mortal maid, has imposed upon her these wanderings.		
A3645	that to marry in one's own class is far the best—a poor man should not desire to marry among those who are pampered by riches, or who are mighty in pride of birth.		
A3646	I know the fact and the means		
A3647	So let him sit there in his assurance, putting his trust in the crash reverberating on high and brandishing his fire-breathing bolt in his hands.  For these shall not protect him  from falling in ignominious and unendurable ruin.Such an adversary is he now preparing despite himself, a prodigy irresistible, even one who shall discover a flame mightier than the lightning and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder; a prodigy who shall shiver the trident,Poseidon's spear, that scourge of the sea and shaker of the land.12Then, wrecked upon this evil, Zeus shall learn how different it is to be a sovereign and a slave.		
A3648	I speak what shall be brought to pass and, moreover, my own desire.		
A3649	Chorus How is it that you are not afraid to utter such taunts? Prometheus Why should I fear since I am fated not to die? Chorus But he might inflict on you an ordeal even more bitter than this. Prometheus Let him, for all I care!  I am prepared for anything.		
A3650	Worship, adore, and fawn upon whoever is your lord.  But for Zeus I care less than nothing.		
A3651	Do you thinkI quail, perhaps, and cower before these upstart gods?  Far from it—no, not at all.		
A3652	For your servitude, rest assured, I'd  not barter my hard lot, not I.		
A3653	I hate all the gods that received good at my hands and with ill requite me wrongfully.		
A3654	But ever-ageing Time teaches all things.		
A3655	Or else I would not have addressed you, an underling		
A3656	There is no torment or device by whichZeus shall induce me to utter this until these injurious fetters are loosed.  So then, let his blazing lightning be hurled, and with the white wings of the snow and thunders of earthquake let him confound the reeling world		
A3657	But if you will not be won to belief by my words,think of what a tempest and a towering wave of woe shall break upon you past escape.  First, the Father will shatter this jagged cliff with thunder and lightning-flame, and will entomb your frame, while the rock shall still hold you clasped in its embrace.But when you have completed a long stretch of time, you shall come back again to the light.  Then indeed the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great rents and feast his fillupon your liver until it is black with gnawing.		
A3658	With him I am content to suffer any fate;		
A3659	for I have learned to detest traitors, and there is no pestI abhor more than this.		
A3660	Men of Cadmus's city, he who guards from the stern the concerns of the State and guides its helm with eyes untouched by sleep must speak to the point.		
A3661	you must aid the State andthe altars of your homeland's gods so that their honors may never be obliterated.		
A3662	You must aid, too, your children, and Mother Earth, your beloved nurse.  For welcoming all the distress of your childhood, when you were young and crept upon her kind soil, she raised you to inhabit her and bear the shield,and to prove yourselves faithful in this time of need.		
A3663	Hurry each of you to the battlements and the gates of our towered walls! Rush with all your armor! Fill the parapets and take your positions on the platforms of the towers.  Stand your ground bravely where the gates open out,and do not be afraid of this crowd of foreigners. God will bring it to a good end.		
A3664	May they never hold the free land and city of Cadmus beneath the yoke of slavery!		
A3665	for a State that prospers pays honors to its gods		
A3666	See this suppliant band of maidens praying to be saved from slavery.		
A3667	May I never share my home with the female race, neither in time of evil nor in pleasant prosperity!		
A3668	This is the sort of trouble you will have if you dwell with women.		
A3669	It is for the man to take care of business outside the house; let no woman make decrees in those matters.		
A3670	For Obedience isthe mother of Success, wife of Salvation—as the saying goes.		
A3671	your duty is to be silent and to remain inside the house.		
A3672	O Zeus, what a breed you have made for us in women!		
A3673	Gods of our city! Do not let my fate be slavery!		
A3674	I vow that, if things go well and the city is saved,the citizens shall redden the gods' altars with the blood of sheep and sacrifice bulls to the gods—this is my vow—and offer trophies, while I will crown their holy temples with the spoil of the enemy's spear-pierced garments.		
A3675	It is a great cause for grief to hurl a primeval city to Hades in this way, quarry and slave of the spear, ravaged shamefully in the dusty ashes by an Argive man through divine will.And grief, too, to let the women be led away captive—ah me!—young and old, dragged by the hair, like horses, with their cloaks torn off them.A city, emptied, shouts out as the human booty perishes with mingled cries.  A heavy fate, indeed, my fear anticipates.

A3681	The tongue proves in the end to be an unerring accuser of men's wicked thoughts		
A3682	Death to him who exults so arrogantly over the city!		
A3683	May the thunderbolt stop him before he leaps into my homeand plunders me from my maiden chambers with his outrageous spear!		
A3684	This one, too, shouts in syllables of written letters that even Ares could not hurl him from the battlements.		
A3685	As they boast too much against the city in their frenzied mind,so, too, may Zeus the Requiter look on them in anger!		
A3686	Rout is boasting of victory at the gate.		
A3687	First Onca Pallas, who dwells near the city, close by the gate, and who loathes outrageousness in a man, will fend him off like a dangerous snake away from nestlings.		
A3688	will drop his head in death before the gate.		
A3689	He swears by his spear which, in his confidence, he holds more to be revered than a godand more precious than his eyes, that he will sack the city of the Cadmeans in spite of Zeus.		
A3690	If only they would get from the gods what they wish for, because of those unholy boasts of theirs, then surely they would perish in utter ruin and misery.		
A3691	If the gods are willing, what I speak may prove true!		
A3692	May the gods destroy them here in our land!		
A3693	Murderer, maker of unrest in the city, principal teacher of evils to the Argives, summoner of vengeance's Curse, servant of Slaughter,counselor to Adrastus in these evil plans.		
A3694	What justice is it to drain dry the font of your existence?		
A3695	I anticipate no dishonorable death.		
A3696	He who reveres the gods is to be feared.		
A3697	nothing is more evilthan evil partnership.		
A3698	For it may be that a pious man, embarked shipboard with sailors hot for some crime, perishes along with the sort of men hated by the gods;or, a man, though upright himself, when among fellow-citizens who hate all strangers and neglect the gods, may fall undeserving into the same trap as they, and be subdued, struck by the scourge of God that strikes all alike.		
A3699	moderate, just, noble, reverent man and a great prophet, mixes with impious, rash-talking men against his own judgment, men stretching out in a procession that is long to retrace

A3701	May Zeus strike themwith his thunderbolt outside the walls and slay them		
A3702	She claims to be Justice, as the lettering indicates, “I will bring this man back and he will have his city and move freely in his father's halls.”		
A3703	Justice would truly be false to her name, if she should ally herself with a man so utterly audacious in his plans.		
A3704	Commander against commander, brother against brother,enemy against enemy, I will take my stand.		
A3705	But you cannot speak of any glory for happenings that are at once evil and held in dishonor.		
A3706	A savage desire eats away at you, drives you to murder, blood-sacrifice proscribed by divine law, whose only fruit is bitterness.		
A3707	Obey us women, although you do not like to.		
A3708	Recommend something that can be accomplished; your request need not be lengthy.		
A3709	And yet any victory, even a cowardly one, is nonetheless held in honor by God.		
A3710	When it is the gods who give you evils, you cannot flee them.		
A3711	O, the new troubles of this house mixed with its evils of before!		
A3712	Now it is as if a sea of evils pushes its swell onward.

A3715	Yes, so all too equal was their destiny to them both.  All alone, in truth, it consumes the ill-fated family.		
A3716	[The city is saved, but through their mutual murder the earth has drunk the blood of the two kings born of the same seed.]		
A3717	,should I rejoice and shout in triumph for the unharmed safety of the city, or should I lament our leaders in war, now wretched, ill-fated and childless?		
A3718	The curseful utterance of their father has done its work and not fallen short.  Laius' plans, made in disobedience, have kept their force.		
A3719	to do their bitter duty, the dirge over their brothers both.		
A3720	The great Erinys of your father Oedipus has fulfilled it all truly.		
A3721	Over these poor men it can be said that they did much to harm our citizens and also the ranks of all the foreignerswho died in abundance in the fighting.		
A3722	Fraternal sorrows stand close by fraternal sorrows.		
A3723	O Fate, giver of grievous troubles, and awful shade of Oedipus, black Erinys, you are indeed a mighty force.		
A3724	for hating the enemy he chose death in the city and driven by piety towards his ancestral shrines, he died without reproach where it is an honor for the young to die.		
A3725	Even in death he will retain the stain of his guilt against his fathers' gods, whom he dishonoredwhen he launched a foreign army against the city to take it.		
A3726	Nor am I ashamed to act in defiant opposition to the rulers of the city.

A3745	My children, you must be prudent.

A3748	Above all let no arrogance accompany your speech		
A3749	and reveal nothing impious in your peaceful eyes, from your respectful face		
A3750	And remember to be submissive: you are an alien, a fugitive, and in need		
A3751	Father, your words are prudent, and they fall on prudent ears.I will take heed of your wise words, and hold them in memory.		
A3752	O Zeus, have pity upon our troubles lest we are ruined.		
A3753	May he have pity indeed, and stand by ready to defend.		
A3754	And how can man be pure who would seize from an unwilling father an unwilling bride?		
A3755	For such an act, not even in Hades, after death, shall he escape arraignment for outrage.There also among the dead, so men tell, another Zeus holds a last judgment upon misdeeds.		
A3756	What stroke of fortune befell you?		
A3757	So as not to be made slave to Aegyptus' race.		
A3758	Or do you speak of unlawfulness ?		
A3759	But Justice protects her champions.		
A3760	Behold me, your suppliant, a fugitive, running around like a heifer chased by wolves upon precipitous crags, where, confident in his help, she lows to tell the herdsman of her distress.		
A3761	Indeed,may Justice, daughter of Zeus the Apportioner, Justice who protects the suppliant, look upon our flight that it bring no mischief in its wake.		
A3762	For myself, I will pledge no promise before I have communicated these events to all the citizens.		
A3763	You must plead in accordance with the laws of the land you have fled, that they have no authority over you.		
A3764	Never, oh never, may I fall subject to the power and authority of these men.  I am determined to flee to escape this marriage that offends my soul, piloting my course by the stars.		
A3765	ake Justice as your ally, and render judgment for the cause deemed righteous by the gods		
A3766	I will not do this thing without the consent of my people,		
A3767	to the wicked their wrongdoing and to the godly their works of righteousness.		
A3768	Surely you cannot think there is no need of salutary counsel?		
A3769	Do not betray the fugitive who has been impiously cast out and driven from afar.		
A3770	Do not see your suppliant dragged, in spite of justice, from the images of the gods,like a horse by the bridle, and see rude hands laid upon my fine-woven robes.		
A3771	For be assured of this—whichever end you bring to pass, to your children and housedoes it remain to make full payment.		
A3772	men's blood to stain the ground for women's sake?		
A3773	And yet the wrath of Zeus who guards the suppliant compels my reverence; for supreme among mortals is the fear of him.		
A3774	for the people could complain against authority.		
A3775	And from your offspring ward off in utter abhorrence the lust of men, and into the purple sea casttheir black-benched madness!		
A3776	all goes well on the part of the citizens.  Decrees, carrying full authority, have been passed.		
A3777	to what end has the decision been carried, and to what course does the majority of the people's votes incline?		
A3778	not by any doubtful vote		
A3779	For the air bristled with right hands held aloft as, in full vote, they ratified this resolution into law		
A3780	uch was the persuasive speech that the king of the Pelasgians delivered on our behalf		
A3781	Hearing these words, the Argive people, waiting for no proclamation of crier, voted by uplifted hand that this should be so.		
A3782	It was the Pelasgian people, won readily to assent, who heard the subtle windings of his speech		
A3783	gratitude		
A3784	for they had compassion for us		
A3785	and cast a vote in our favor		
A3786	respecting  our pitiable flock, suppliants in the name of Zeus.		
A3787	Nor did they cast their votes for the side of the males,disregarding the women's cause		
A3788	May the people who control the state guard its privileges free from fear—a prudent government counselling wisely for the public prosperity.		
A3789	Since reverence for parents stands written third among the statutes of Justice, to whom honor supreme is due.		
A3790	he who dishonors the gods will suffer punishment.		
A3791	Since the vote of the Argives was final,be of good cheer, my children; they will fight in your defence, I know this well.		
A3792	A woman abandoned to herself is nothing.		
A3793	They are overweening, maddened, with unholy rage, shameless dogs that do not respect the gods.		
A3794	The evil is no longer escapable		
A3795	before I am ever forced into a marriage that would pierce my heart!		
A3796	Come death, death be my doom,before the marriage-bed!  How can I yet find some means of escape to deliver me from marriage?		
A3797	For the males of the race of Aegyptus, intolerable in their wantonness, chase after me,a fugitive, with clamorous lewdness and seek to lay hold of me with violence.		
A3798	arrogance		
A3799	You will get yourself speedily on board, on board, I say, whether you will or not, by force, by force. . .		
A3800	Wail and shout and call upon the gods—you will not escape the Egyptian ship.Cry out, utter a strain of woe more bitter still.		
A3801	arrogantly		
A3802	and destroy you.		
A3803	Let no one delay, for dragging by force has no mercy on locks of hair.		
A3804	O King, we are suffering impious violence!		
A3805	I think I will have to seize you by the hair and drag you offsince you are slow to heed my orders.		
A3806	What kind of arrogance has incited you to do such dishonor to this realm of Pelasgian men?		
A3807	Indeed, do you think you have come to a land of women?		
A3808	If that be the case, many a one shall fall and shuffle off his life.		
A3809	But to this purpose a decree has been passed by the unanimous resolve of the people of the State, never, under compulsion, to surrender this association of women.		
A3810	you hear the truth from free-spoken lips		
A3811	whose resolve this is that now takes effect.		
A3812	Why wait for others of higher authority?		
A3813	Recipients of such favors as these,it becomes us to hold gratitude in yet higher honor from the bottom of our hearts.		
A3814	For in an alien's case, all the world bears an evil tongue in readiness,and it is easy lightly to utter  defiling slander.		
A3815	So all men, as they pass,mastered by desire, shoot an alluring arrow of the eye at the delicate beauty of virgins.  See to it, therefore, that we do not suffer that in fear for which we have endured great toil and ploughed the great waters with our ship; and that we bring no shame to ourselves and exultation to our enemies.		
A3816	But for the fugitives I have boding fears of blasts of harm and cruel distress and bloody wars.		
A3817	Marriage has been the destiny of many women before our time.		
A3818	May sovereign Zeus spare me cruel marriage with a man I hate, that very Zeus whomercifully freed Io from pain, restoring her with healing hand by kindly force.		
A3819	And may he award victory to the women!I		
A3820	Ah! I remember that I wasdelighted in soul when Cleon had to disgorge those five talents;2 I wasin ecstasy and I love the Knights for this deed;		
A3821	Ah! I remember that I wasdelighted in soul when Cleon had to disgorge those five talents;2 I wasin ecstasy and I love the Knights for this deed; 3		
A3822	ut the day when I was impatiently awaiting a piece byAeschylus,4 what tragic despair it caused me when the herald called,Theognis,5 introduce your Chorus! Just imagine how this blow struckstraight at my heart!		
A3823	On the other hand, what joy Dexitheus causedme at the musical competition, when he played a Boeotian melodyon the lyre!  But this year by contrast! Oh! what deadly tortureto hear Chaeris6 perform the prelude in the Orthian mode		
A3824	The Prytanes10 even do not come; they will belate, but when they come they will push and fight each other for aseat in the front row.  They will never trouble themselves with thequestion of peace.		
A3825	Oh!  Athens! Athens! As for myself, I do not fail tocome here before all the rest, and now, finding myself alone, I groan,yawn, stretch, break wind, and know not what to do; I make sketches inthe dust, pull out my loose hairs, muse, think of my fields, long forpeace,		
A3826	it is to me alone that the gods have entrusted the duty oftreating with the Lacedaemonians.		
A3827	Prytanes, in expelling this citizen, you are offering an outrageto the Assembly.  He only desired to secure peace for us and to sheathethe sword.		
A3828	PRYTANIS Sit down and keep silence! DICAEOPOLIS No, by Apollo, I will not, unless you are going to discuss thequestion of peace.		
A3829	Is this not sufficient to drive one to hang oneself?  Here Istand chilled to the bone, whilst the doors of the Prytaneum flywide open to lodge such rascals.		
A3830	Take these eight drachmae and go and conclude a truce with theLacedaemonians for me, my wife and my children; I leave you free,my dear citizens, to send out embassies and to stand gaping in the air.		
A3831	was hurrying to bring your treaty of truce, but some old dotardsfrom Acharnae34 got scent of the thing;		
A3832	This last is a truce of thirty years, both on sea and land. DICAEOPOLIS Oh! by Bacchus! what a bouquet!  It has the aroma of nectar andambrosia;		
A3833	to conclude a truce, when I wantedthe war continued with double fury in order to avenge my ruined lands.		
A3834	It is well! Oh, mighty Bacchus, it is with joy that, freed frommilitary duty, I and all mine perform this solemn rite and offerthee this sacrifice; grant that I may keep the rural Dionysiawithout hindrance and that this truce of thirty years may bepropitious for me.		
A3835	h, Phales,47 companion of the orgiesof Bacchus, night reveller, god of adultery, friend of young men, thesepast six48 years I have not been able to invoke thee.		
A3836	You ask that, you impudent rascal, traitor to your country; youalone amongst us all have concluded a truce, and you dare to look usin the face!		
A3837	Listen to your long speeches, after you have treated with theLaconians?  No, I will punish you. DICAEOPOLIS Friends, leave the Laconians out of debate and consider onlywhether I have not done well to conclude my truce.		
A3838	Here is the block; and, though I am but a very sorry speaker, Iwish nevertheless to talk freely of the Lacedaemonians and without theprotection of my buckler.		
A3839	Come, let us knock at the door.Euripides, my little Euripides, my darling Euripides, listen;never had man greater right to your pity.		
A3840	But, Euripides, on my kneesI beseech you, give me the tatters of some old piece; for I have totreat the Chorus to a long speech, and if I do it ill it is all overwith me.		
A3841	Art thousensible of the dangerous battle we are about to engage upon indefending the Lacedaemonians?  Courage, my soul, we must plungeinto the midst of it.  Dost thou hesitate and art thou fully steepedin Euripides?		
A3842	That's right! do not falter, my poor heart, and let us riskour head to say what we hold for truth.  Courage and boldly tothe front.  I wonder I am so brave.		
A3843	Spectators, be not angered if, although I am a beggar, I dare ina Comedy to speak before the people of Athens of the public weal;Comedy too can sometimes discern what is right.		
A3844	I shall not please,but I shall say what is true.		
A3845	But come (there are only friends whohear me), why accuse the Laconians of all our woes?		
A3846	SECOND SEMI-CHORUS By Poseidon! he speaks the truth; he has not lied in a single detail. FIRST SEMI-CHORUS But though it be true, need he say it?  But you'll have no greatcause to be proud of your insolence!		
A3847	Violence is out of place here!		
A3848	Who am I?  A good citizen, not ambitious; a soldier, who has foughtwell since the outbreak of the war, whereas you are but a vilemercenary.		
A3849	And why do you always receive your pay, when none of theseothers ever gets any?		
A3850	For my own part, I make proclamation to all Peloponnesians,Megarians and Boeotians, that to them my markets are open; but I debarLamachus from entering them.		
A3851	Never since our poet presented Comedies, has he praised himselfupon the stage; but, having been slandered by his enemies amongstthe volatile Athenians, accused of scoffing at his country and ofinsulting the people, to-day he wishes to reply and regain for himselfthe inconstant Athenians.		
A3852	In cautioning you againstsuch wiles, the poet has done you great service as well asin forcing you to understand what is really the democraticprinciple.		
A3853	In cautioning you againstsuch wiles, the poet has done you great service as well asin forcing you to understand what is really the democraticprinciple.  Thus, the strangers, who came to pay their tributes,wanted to see this great poet, who had dared to speak the truth toAthens.		
A3854	And so far has the fame of his boldness reached that one daythe Great King, when questioning the Lacedaemonian delegates, firstasked them which of the two rival cities was the superior at sea,and then immediately demanded at which it was that the comic poetdirected his biting satire.  Happy that city, he added, if itlistens to his counsel; it will grow in power, and its victory isassured.		
A3855	As for you, never lose him, who willalways fight for the cause of justice in his Comedies; he promises youthat his precepts will lead you to happiness, though he uses neitherflattery, nor bribery, nor intrigue, nor deceit; instead of loadingyou with praise, he will point you to the better way.		
A3856	We others, now old men and heavy with years, we reproach the city;so many are the victories we have gained for the Athenian fleetsthat we well deserve to be cared for in our declining life;		
A3857	make a law that in the future, the old mancan only be summoned and convicted at the courts by the agedand the young man by the youth.		
A3858	These are the confines of my market-place.  All Peloponnesians,Megarians, Boeotians, have the right to come and trade here,provided they sell their wares to me and not to Lamachus.		
A3859	Oh! my well-beloved, thou object of my long regrets, thou art hereat last then, thou, after whom the comic poets sigh, thou, who artdear to Morychus.103  Slaves, hither with the stove and the bellows.Look at this charming eel, that returns to us after six long yearsof absence.		
A3860	You see, citizens, you see the good fortune which this man owes tohis prudence, to his profound wisdom.  You see how, since he hasconcluded peace, he buys what is useful in the household and good toeat hot.		
A3861	Oh, Peace! companion of fair Aphrodite and of the sweet Graces,how charming are thy features and yet I never knew it!  Would that Erosmight join me to thee, Eros, crowned with roses as Zeuxis112 shows him tous!		
A3862	Women, children, have you not heard?  Faith! do you not heed theherald?  Quick! let the hares boil and roast merrily;		
A3863	This man has discovered the sweetest enjoyment in peace; he will share itwith none.		
A3864	he bride burns with longingto keep by her her husband's weapon.  Come! \bring hither my truce; toher alone will I give some of it, for she is a woman, and, as such,should not suffer under the war.		
A3865	Come, what do you wish to say?  (THE BRIDESMAID WHISPERS IN    HIS EAR.)  Ah! what a ridiculous demand!  The bride burns with longingto keep by her her husband's weapon.  Come! \bring hither my truce; toher alone will I give some of it, for she is a woman, and, as such,should not suffer under the war.		
A3866	DICAEOPOLIS (ENTERS WITH TWO COURTESANS) Oh!  my gods!  what bosoms!  Hard as a quince!  Come, my treasures, giveme voluptuous kisses!  Glue your lips to mine.  Haha! I was the first toempty my cup. LAMACHUS Oh! cruel fate! how I suffer!  accursed wounds!		
A3867	You triumph then, brave champion; thine is the wine-skin! DICAEOPOLIS Follow me, singing Triumph! Triumph! CHORUS Aye!  we will sing of thee, thee and thy sacred wine-skin, and we all,as we follow thee, will repeat in thine honour, Triumph, Triumph!		
A3868	DICAEOPOLIS Take me to the judges.  Where is the king of the feast?The wine-skin is mine! LAMACHUS That spear has pierced my bones; what torture I endure!		
A3869	Thou are but a great braggart; but get your way; Iwill find out the truth by myself.		
A3870	Thus, the strangers, who came to pay their tributes,wanted to see this great poet, who had dared to speak the truth toAthens.		
A3871	This is why the Lacedaemonians offer you peace, if youwill cede them Aegina; not that they care for the isle, but theywish to rob you of your poet		
A3872	Our minds and bodies being ravagedwith age, Poseidon should protect us, yet we have no other support thana staff.		
A3873	I am going to disguiseyou as little porkers, that I am offering for sale.		
A3874	ll good things flow towards him unsought.  Never will I welcomethe god of war in my house;		
A3875	BRIDESMAID And in return, he prays you to pour a glass of peace into this vase,that he may not have to go to the front and may stay at hometo do his duty to his young wife. DICAEOPOLIS Take back, take back your viands; for a thousand drachmae Iwould not give a drop of peace; but who are you, pray?		
A3876	Let us save the ship of state, which just at present none seems able either to sail or row.		
A3877	Nothing simpler. Is it not said that the cleverest speakers are those who get made love to most often? Well, thanks to the gods, we are that by nature.		
A3878	May the gods grant success to my plans!		
A3879	Citizens, you are the ones who are the cause of all this trouble. You vote yourselves salaries out of the public funds and care only for your own personal interests; hence the state limps along like Aesimus.		
A3880	I assert that the direction of affairs must be handed over to the women, for they are the ones who have charge and look after our households.		
A3881	Let us therefore hand Athens over to them without endless discussions, without bothering ourselves about what they will do; let us simply hand them over the power, remembering that they are mothers and will therefore spare the blood of our soldiers;		
A3882	Let us drive away these men of the city who used to stay at home and chatter round the table in the days when only an obolus was paid, whereas now one is stifled by the crowds at the Pnyx. No! during the archonship of generous Myronides, none would have dared to let himself be paid for the trouble he spent over public business; each one brought his own meal of bread, a couple of onions, three olives and some wine in a little wine-skin. But nowadays we run here to earn the three obols, for the citizen has become as mercenary as the stonemason.		
A3883	h! what a damned fool I was to take a wife at my age, and how I could thrash myself for having acted so stupidly! It's certainty she's not gone out for any honest purpose		
A3884	He maintained that women were both clever and thrifty, that they never divulged the Mysteries of Demeter, while you and I go about babbling incessantly about whatever happens at the Senate.		
A3885	I want all to have a share of everything and all property to be in common; there will no longer be either rich or poor; no longer shall we see one man harvesting vast tracts of land, while another has not ground enough to be buried in, nor one man surround himself with a whole army of slaves, while another has not a single attendant; I intend that there shall only be one and the same condition of life for all.		
A3886	shall begin by making land, money, everything that is private property, common to all. Then we shall live on this common wealth, which we shall take care to administer with wise thrift.		
A3887	The poor will no longer be obliged to work; each will have all that he needs, bread, salt fish, cakes, tunics, wine, chaplets and chick-pease;		
A3888	The ugliest and the most flat-nosed will be side by side with the most charming, and to win the latter's favours, a man will first have to get into the former.		
A3889	Athens will become nothing more than a single house, in which everything will belong to everyone; so that everybody will be able to go from one house to the other at pleasure.		
A3890	and young children will sing the glory of the brave from there, also the infamy of cowards,who out of very shame will no longer dare to come to the public meals.		
A3891	What folly to carry one's goods to the common store; I have a little more sense than that. No, no, by Poseidon, I want first to ponder and calculate over the thing at leisure. I shall not be fool enough to strip myself of the fruits of my toil and thrift, if it is not for a very good reason; let us see first which way things turn.		
A3892	Second Man Oh! this is the height of folly! First Man Because I obey the law? Second Man Is that the duty of a smart man? First Man Absolutely. Second Man Say rather of a ninny.		
A3893	Let me see! let me think of some good trick by which I can keep my goods and yet take my share of the common feast.		
A3894	Don't be jealous of the young girls; voluptuousness resides in the pure outline of their beautiful limbs and blossoms on their rounded breasts;		
A3895	This way, my love, this way, come here and haste to rest the whole night in my arms. I worship your lovely curly hair; I am consumed with ardent desire. Oh! Eros, in thy mercy, compel him to my bed.		
A3896	Oh! Eros, I beseech thee, have mercy and make her share my couch.		
A3897	Young Woman  Words cannot express the tortures  I am suffering. Oh! my adored one, I adjure you, open your door for me and press me to your heart; 'tis for you that I am suffering. Young Man Oh! my jewel, my idol, you child of Aphrodite, the confidante of the Muses, the sister of the Graces, you living picture of voluptuousness, oh! open for me, press me to your heart,'tis for you that I am suffering.		
A3898	First Man Don't you propose taking what belongs to you to the common stock? Second Man I'll take good care I don't until I see what the majority are doing.		
A3899	Thou alone shinest into the secret recesses of our thighs and dost singe the hair that groweth there, and with thy flame dost light the actions of our loves. If we open some cellar stored with fruits and wine, thou art our companion, and never dost thou betray or reveal to a neighbor the secrets thou hast learned about us.		
A3900	herefore thou shalt know likewise the whole of the plot that I have planned with my friends, the women, at the festival of the Scirophoria.		
A3901	I see none of those I was expecting, though dawn approaches; the Assembly is about to gather and we must take our seats in spite of Phyromachus, who forsooth would say, “It is meet the women sit apart and hidden from the eyes of the men.” Why, have they not been able then to procure the false beards that they must wear, or to steal their husbands' cloaks?		
A3902	Let us fix these beards on our chins, so that they spread all over our bosoms. How can we fail then to be mistaken for men?		
A3903	Agyrrhius has deceived everyone, thanks to the beard of Pronomus; yet he was no better than a woman, and you see how he now holds the first position in the city.		
A3904	That's why their decrees breathe of drunkenness and madness. And why libations, why so many ceremonies, if wine plays no part in them? Besides, they abuse each other like drunken men, and you can see the archers dragging more than one uproarious drunkard out of the market-place.		
A3905	All these details of language must be adjusted; else it is quite useless to go to the Assembly.		
A3906	My country is as dear to me as it is to you, and I groan, I am grieved at all that is happening in it.		
A3907	Scarcely one in ten of those who rule it is honest, and all the others are bad. If you appoint fresh chiefs, they will do still worse. It is hard to correct your peevish humor; you fear those who love you and throw yourselves at the feet of those who betray you.		
A3908	There was a time when we had no assemblies, and then we all thought Agyrrhius a dishonest man; now they are established, he who gets money thinks everything is as it should be, and he who does not, declares all who sell their votes to be worthy of death.		
A3909	Is there talk of equipping a fleet? The poor man says, yes, but the rich citizen and the countryman say, no.		
A3910	besides, who will know better than a mother how to forward provisions to the front?		
A3911	Woman is adept at getting money for herself and will not easily let herself be deceived; she understands deceit too well herself.		
A3912	Woman is adept at getting money for herself and will not easily let herself be deceived; she understands deceit too well herself. I omit a thousand other advantages. Take my advice and you will live in perfect happiness.		
A3913	When the countryfolk were seeking refuge in the city, I lived on the Pnyx with my husband, and there I learnt to speak through listening to the orators.		
A3914	Quick now, put on these tunics and these Laconian shoes, as you see the men do each time they go to the Assembly or for a walk. When this is done, fix on your beards, and when they are arranged in the best way possible, dress yourselves in the cloaks you have stolen from your husbands; finally start off, leaning on your staffs and singing some old man's song as the villagers do.		
A3915	Move forward, citizens, move forward; let us not forget to give ourselves this name and may that of woman never slip out of our mouths; woe to us, if it were discovered that we had laid such a plot in the darkness of night.		
A3916	for the Thesmothetes have declared that only those who arrive at daybreak with haggard eye and covered with dust, without having snatched time to eat anything but a snack of garlic-pickle, shall alone receive the triobolus. Walk up smartly, Charitimides, Smicythus and Draces, and do not fail in any point of your part; let us first demand our fee and then vote for all that may perchance be useful for our partisans.		
A3917	There was a crowd, such as has never been seen at the Pnyx, and the folk looked pale and wan, like so many shoemakers, so white were they in hue; both I and many another had to go without the triobolus.		
A3918	The Prytanes started the discussion of measures closely concerning the safety of the state; immediately, that blear-eyed fellow, the son of Neoclides, was the first to mount the platform. Then the folk shouted with their loudest voice, “What! he dares to speak, and that, too, when the safety of the state is concerned, and he a man who has not known how to save even his own eyebrows!”		
A3919	Then we saw a handsome young man rush into the tribune, he was all pink and white like young Nicias, and he began to say that the direction of matters should be entrusted to the women; this the crowd of shoemakers began applauding with all their might, while the country-folk assailed him with groans.		
A3920	Then he added that the women lend each other clothes, trinkets of gold and silver, drinking-cups, and not before witnesses too, but all by themselves, and that they return everything with exactitude without ever cheating each other;whereas, according to him, we are ever ready to deny the loans we have effected.		
A3921	Again, he said that women were not informers, nor did they bring lawsuits, nor hatch conspiracies; in short, he praised the women in every possible manner.		
A3922	Blepyrus And what was decided? Chremes To confide the direction of affairs to them; it's the one and only innovation that has not yet been tried at Athens.		
A3923	Blepyrus Thus it will be my wife who will go to the courts now in my stead? Chremes And it will be she who will keep your children in your place.		
A3924	Blepyrus Ah! but I hate compulsion. Chremes But if it is for the public good, let us resign ourselves.		
A3925	It's an old saying that our absurdest and maddest decrees always somehow turn out for our good.		
A3926	Let us not lose a moment in taking off our false beards,for we might be recognized and denounced. Let us stand under the shadow of this wall; let us glance round sharply with our eye to beware of surprises, while we quickly resume our ordinary dress.Ah! here is our leader, returning from the Assembly. Hasten to relieve your chins of these flowing manes. Look at your comrades yonder; they have already made themselves women again some while ago.		
A3927	Now tell us how we can be of service to you, so that we may show you our obedience, for we have never seen a cleverer woman than you.		
A3928	I only wish to use the power given me in accordance with your wishes; for, in the market-place, in the midst of the shouts and danger, I appreciated your indomitable courage.		
A3929	hat you may rule ... Praxagora What? Blepyrus ... over all public business. Praxagora As she exclaims this Chremes reappears. Oh! by Aphrodite! how happy Athens will be! Blepyrus Why so? Praxagora For a thousand reasons. None will dare now to do shameless deeds, to give false testimony or lay informations.		
A3930	There will be no more thieves, nor envious people, no more rags nor misery, no more abuse and no more prosecutions and law-suits.		
A3931	Praxagora There will be no more thieves, nor envious people, no more rags nor misery, no more abuse and no more prosecutions and law-suits.		
A3932	Devote the fecundity of your mind to the public weal; adorn the citizens' lives with a thousand enjoyments and teach them to seize every favourable opportunity. Devise some ingenious method to secure the much-needed salvation of Athens;		
A3933	but let neither your acts nor your words recall anything of the past, for 'tis only innovations that please.		
A3934	Praxagora I believe my ideas are good, but what I fear is that the public will cling to the old customs and refuse to accept my reforms. Blepyrus Have no fear about that. Love of novelty and disdain for traditions, these are the dominating principles among us.		
A3935	his is what I was going to say: I shall begin by making land, money, everything that is private property, common to all. Then we shall live on this common wealth, which we shall take care to administer with wise thrift.		
A3936	but now that all goods are in common, what will he gain by not bringing his wealth into the general stock?		
A3937	I intend that women shall belong to all men in common, and each shall beget children by any man that wishes to have her.		
A3938	Praxagora The ugliest and the most flat-nosed will be side by side with the most charming, and to win the latter's favours, a man will first have to get into the former. Blepyrus		
A3939	Hitherto, when anyone saw an old man beaten, he would not meddle, because it did not concern him; but now each will fear the sufferer may be his own father and such violence will be stopped.		
A3940	Blepyrus There will be no more thieves then, eh? Praxagora Why steal, if you have a share of everything?		
A3941	Even if you sleep outdoors there will be no more danger, for all will have the means of living. Besides, if anyone wanted to steal your cloak, you would give it to him yourself. Why not? You will only have to go to the common store and be given a better one.		
A3942	I must now go to the market-place to receive the property that is going to be placed in common and to choose a woman with a loud voice as my herald. I have all the cares of state on my shoulders, since the power has been entrusted to me.		
A3943	Giving is not one of our customs. Receiving is another matter; it's the way of the gods themselves. Look at the position of their hands on their statues; when we ask a favour, they present their hands turned palm up so as not to give, but to receive.		
A3944	it's only the women of ripe age who understand the art of love, and no one could know how to fondle the lover who possessed me so well as myself; the young girls are all flightiness.		
A3945	Ah! could I but sleep with the young girl without first making love to the old flat-nose! It is intolerable for a free-born man.		
A3946	The women have decreed that if a young man desires a young girl, he can only lay her after having satisfied an old woman; and if he refuses and goes to seek the maiden, the old women are authorized to seize him and drag him in.”		
A3947	A young fellow like him is not of the age to suit you.You ought to be his mother rather than his wife. With these laws in force, the earth will be filled with Oedipuses.		
A3948	Hi! you there! where are you taking that young man to, in defiance of the law? The decree ordains that he must first sleep with me.		
A3949	Happy are ye, who form choruses before our house!  Happy are ye, both neighbors and fellow-citizens! Happy am I myself! I am but a servant, and yet I have poured on my hair the most exquisite essences.  Let thanks be rendered to thee, Oh, Zeus!		
A3950	Generously invite everyone and omit no one, old or young.  Dinner is ready for all; they need only go home.		
A3951	If the lot has assigned my comedy to be played first of all, don't let that be a disadvantage to me; engrave in your memory all that shall have pleased you in it and judge the competitors equitably as you have bound yourselves by oath to do.		
A3952	Don't act like vile courtesans, who never remember any but their last lover.		
A3953	Second Woman I had rather have seen one of your regular orators giving you wise advice; but, as that is not to be, it behoves me to break silence; I cannot, for my part indeed, allow the tavern-keepers to fill up their wine-pits with water. No, by the two goddesses— Praxagora What? By the two goddesses! Wretched woman, where are your senses? Second Woman Eh! what? ... I have not asked you for a drink. Praxagora No, but you want to pass for a man, and you swear by the two goddesses. Otherwise you did very well.		
A3954	When we were discussing the alliance, it seemed as though it were all over with Athens if it fell through. No sooner was it made than we were vexed and angry, and the orator who had caused its adoption was compelled to seek safety in flight.		
A3955	I want a clever poet, for the race is now extinct—all who survive are bad.		
A3956	These are but stunted offshoots and mere blatherings, showcases of swallows, banes of The Art, which disappear at once, if they get a single chorus, just one chance to piss on tragedy. You'll not find one creative poet, if you looked, to bawl a noble sentiment.		
A3957	Let him be mute and stand aside from our sacred dances who has no experience of mystical language, or has not cleansed his mind Who never has seen and never has danced in the rites of the noble Muses		
A3958	All these I warn, and twice I warn, and thrice I warn again, stand aside from our mystical dances;		
A3959	We alone enjoy the sun and the light who have been initiated and follow the way of piety towards strangers and laymen.		
A3960	It is right and just for our sacred chorus  to advise and teach what's good for the city.  So first it seems best to us to equalize the citizens and take away their fears		
A3961	And if anyone went astray, tripped by the wrestling moves  of Phrynichus, I say it should be possible for those who slipped up then to plead their cause and erase their previous mistakes.		
A3962	But letting up on your anger, you who are wisest in nature, let's gladly make everyone our kinsman and full-fledged citizens too, who's ever fought for us at  sea.		
A3963	Many times it seems to us the city has done the same thing with the best and the brightest of its  citizens as with the old coinage and the new gold currency.		
A3964	But now, you dimwits, change your ways, and employ the good ones again.  And if you succeed, it's praiseworthy.  But if you stumble, at least you'll hang from a respectable tree— So wise men will think, if anything happens to you.		
A3965	There is a custom established here, in all the great and noble arts that the best man in his own field of talent gets his meals in the Town Hall, and the seat next to Pluto...		
A3966	“Persuasion has no other shrine save speech.”		
A3967	They are my friends, and I won't judge them. For I will not be on hostile terms with either one. One I consider clever, the other I enjoy.		
A3968	I came down here for a poet. For what purpose? So that the city might be saved to stage its choruses. So whichever of you will give the state some useful advice, that's the one I think I'll take.		
A3969	I hate that citizen, who, to help his fatherland, seems slow, but swift to do great harm, of profit to himself, but useless to the state.		
A3970	By Zeus the Savior, I can't decide. For one has spoken cleverly, and the other one clearly. Now each of you once more tell me your opinion about the state, what plan you have to save her.		
A3971	When we what faithless is do faithful hold And what is faithful faithless... Dionysus How's that?  I don't understand. Speak with less erudition and more clarity.		
A3972	If we distrusted those citizens in whom We now place confidence, and employed those we don't use now, we would be saved. If we now are suffering under the present circumstances, why wouldn't we be saved by doing the opposite?		
A3973	When they consider the land of the enemy to be their own, and their own the enemy's, their ships a revenue, and their revenue a loss.		
A3974	My tongue did swear, but Aeschylus I choose.		
A3975	Dionysus By Zeus the Savior, I can't decide. For one has spoken cleverly, and the other one clearly. Now each of you once more tell me your opinion about the state, what plan you have to save her.		
A3976	For this man of proven good sense will go back home again for the good of his citizens, for the good of his own relatives and friends, on account of being intelligent.		
A3977	Well then, farewell, Aeschylus, go and save our city with noble sentiments, and educate the dunces.		
A3978	But you hand over my throne to Sophocles to guard and preserve, if I ever come here again.  For him I judge to be second in talent. And remember that that villainous fellow, that liar, that clown will never sit on my throne not even by accident.		
A3979	I'll do it.  But you hand over my throne to Sophocles to guard and preserve, if I ever come here again.  For him I judge to be second in talent. And remember that that villainous fellow, that liar, that clown will never sit on my throne not even by accident.		
A3980	Oh, you who first of the Greeks built solemn phrases and decorated tragic nonsense, take heart and let loose your spout.		
A3981	This is the stuff poets should work on.  Just look right from the start how useful the noble race of poets has been.		
A3982	And many other brave men too, of which the hero Lamachos was one; from Homer, my brain composed many great feats of valor, of Patrocluses, lion-hearted Teucrians, so I could rouse the citizenry to strive to equal them, when it hears the call to arms.		
A3983	But by God, I never created whores like Phaedra and Sthenoboea No one's ever known me to write about any woman in love.		
A3984	Since you persuaded noble ladies, wives of noble men to drink hemlock out of shame because of people like that Bellerophon of yours.		
A3985	No, it existed.  But a poet should conceal wickedness, not bring it forward and teach it. For little boys have a teacher who advises them, and grown-ups have  poets. We have a serious obligation to speak of honorable things.		
A3986	Then again, you taught them to practice drivel and gossip, which emptied the gymnasia and ruined the butts of our prattling youths, and persuaded the Paralian crews to argue with their officers.		
A3987	Of what crimes is he not guilty? Didn't he show pimps, women giving birth in temples, sleeping with their brothers, claiming that life is not life?		
A3988	Great the event, abundant the strife, grand the war that advances. So it's hard work to choose when one strains violently, while the other can twist around and bear down sharply.		
A3989	So for what you have to quarrel over, speak out, lay on, beat up, the old stuff and the new, and dare to say something subtle and smart.		
A3990	So fear not, but scrutinize every topic, for the audience's sake at least, since they're so sophisticated.		
A3991	Now is this not outrage and utter insolence, That I myself, Dionysos, son of Winejug, must walk, and let this fellow ride, so he might feel no pain and bear no burden?		
A3992	Dionysus I want a clever poet, for the race is now extinct—all who survive are bad.		
A3993	Euripides is such a scoundrel, he might well try to run away with me, but Sophocles was easy going here, and easy going there as well.		
A3994	You'll not find one creative poet, if you looked, to bawl a noble sentiment.		
A3995	These are but stunted offshoots and mere blatherings, showcases of swallows, banes of The Art, which disappear at once, if they get a single chorus, just one chance to piss on tragedy.		
A3996	I will not take the Slave, unless he fought at sea, to save his hide.		
A3997	Rightly so, you busybody. the Muses of the fine lyre love us And so does horn-crested Pan, playing his reed pipe. And the harpist Apollo delights in us as well, On account of the reed, which as a bridge for his lyre I nourish in the water of the pond. Brekekekex koax koax.		
A3998	He knows that I'm a warrior, and he's jealous. There's nothing quite so boastful as that Heracles.		
A3999	Whoever does not eliminate hateful factionalism, and is disagreeable to the citizens, but kindles and fans civil strife, in his thirst for private advantage:		
A4000	Or any politician who bites off the pay of the poets For being ridiculed in the ancestral rites of Dionysus.		
A4001	All these I warn, and twice I warn, and thrice I warn again, stand aside from our mystical dances; but as for you: arouse the song and the night-long dances, that belong to our festival here.		
A4002	Here, take this slave of mine, and torture him, And if you find that I've done wrong, take me out and kill  me.		
A4003	I say that I am Dionysus, son of Zeus, And this man is my slave.		
A4004	A fair offer! whichever of us two You first see cry or noticing at all being beaten, be sure he's not the God.		
A4005	Because it's disgraceful that those who fought just once at  sea should suddenly be Plataeans and masters instead of  slaves.		
A4006	It is right and just for our sacred chorus  to advise and teach what's good for the city.  So first it seems best to us to equalize the citizens and take away their fears.		
A4007	So too the citizens whom we know to be noble and virtuous, and righteous and true men of quality and trained in the palaestra and dancing and music, these we despise, but the brazen foreigners and redheads worthless sons of worthless fathers, these we use for  everything, these latest parvenus, whom the city before this wouldn't have lightly used even for random scapegoats.		
A4008	Until someone wiser in the art arrives Than he, and then must he give way.		
A4009	Then he, all excited, claimed the throne where Aeschylus was sitting.		
A4010	Not him, by Zeus, but he kissed Aeschylus When he arrived, and shook his hand, And yielded the chair to him.		
A4011	But let's go in; for when masters are in a hurry, it means trouble for us.		
A4012	I will never yield the chair, no more advice; For I claim to be this man's superior in the art.		
A4013	Hold on there, much-distinguished Aeschylus: And you, you rogue Euripides,  get out of the way of this hailstorm, if you are wise,		
A4014	I am prepared, and do not delay, to bite, be bitten first, if that's his preference, as to the lines and lyrics, the sinews of a tragedy,		
A4015	My Poetry did not die with me, as his has died with him, so he'll have it to recite.		
A4016	Come now, someone bring incense and fire, So I can pray before the show of wits to judge this contest most aesthetically.		
A4017	But when I first received the art from you, she was swollen from bombast and ponderous diction, at once I slimmed her down and took off weight		
A4018	Then from the opening words I permitted nothing idle; my woman spoke, as did the slave as well, Or master, maiden, or old woman.		
A4019	For this was a democratic thing I did.		
A4020	ntroducing domestic matters which we're used to and understand, on which I could be tested. For these folks are knowledgeable, and could have criticized my art.		
A4021	Well, to ponder such things, I instructed these folks here, putting logic in my art and scrutiny, so now they notice everything and know through and through most especially how to run the household better than before,		
A4022	Answer me, why should one admire a poet? Euripides For cleverness, and giving good advice, since we improve the people in the cities.		
A4023	Consider now what kind of men he first received from  me if they were generous and six feet tall, no runaway citizens, no loafers, rascals, like now, nor miscreants, but men who breathed spears and lances, white-crested  helmets, and headgear, and greaves and sevenfold oxhide tempers.		
A4024	For Orpheus taught us rites and to refrain from killing, And Musaeus taught the cures of illness and oracles, and  Hesiod the working of the land, harvest seasons, plowing.  Divine Homer, Where did he get honor and glory if not from teaching useful things, battle lines, courageous deeds, men's armory?		
A4025	And then our state is filled with these bureaucrats and oafish democratic apes always cheating the people, and there's no one able to carry the torch any more because of lack of training.		
A4026	But if you're both afraid that our spectators lack a certain amount of knowledge, so as not to appreciate the fine points of what you say, don't worry about that, since that is no longer the case. For they are seasoned veterans and each one has a book and understands the clever stuff.		
A4027	“Death is the only God that loves not bribes...”		
A4028	Now each of you once more tell me your opinion about the state, what plan you have to save her.		
A4029	As to the state, now tell me, first, what people does she employ?  The good ones, perhaps? Dionysus Where'd you get that idea? She hates them worst of all—		
A4030	Remember now the Gods by whom you swore to take me home, and choose your friends.		
A4031	Blessed is the man having perfected intelligence.		
A4032	Well then, farewell, Aeschylus, go and save our city with noble sentiments, and educate the dunces.  There's plenty of them.		
A4033	First grant bon voyage to the departing poet as he rises to the light, ye spirits under the earth, and grant to the city good ideas for great gains.		
A4034	First grant bon voyage to the departing poet as he rises to the light, ye spirits under the earth, and grant to the city good ideas for great gains. For we would then cease completely from these great woes and dire clashes in arms.		
A4035	I am hot all over with blushes for our sex. Men say we're slippery rogues—		
A4036	My dear, they'll come. It's hard for women, you know, To get away. There's so much to do; Husbands to be patted and put in good tempers:		
A4037	No man's connected with it; If that was the case, they'd soon come fluttering along.		
A4038	So fine it comes to this—Greece saved by Woman!		
A4039	LYSISTRATA So fine it comes to this—Greece saved by Woman! CALONICE By Woman? Wretched thing, I'm sorry for it.		
A4040	Our country's fate is henceforth in our hands:		
A4041	But if the women join us From Peloponnesus and Boeotia, then Hand in hand we'll rescue Greece.		
A4042	Still, thought is free.... But if the women join us From Peloponnesus and Boeotia, then Hand in hand we'll rescue Greece.		
A4043	No man will lift a lance against another—		
A4044	Welcome Lampito! Dear Spartan girl with a delightful face, Washed with the rosy spring, how fresh you look In the easy stride of your sleek slenderness, Why you could strangle a bull!		
A4045	Are you not sad your children's fathers Go endlessly off soldiering afar In this plodding war? I am willing to wager There's not one here whose husband is at home.		
A4046	And not the slightest glitter of a lover! And since the Milesians betrayed us, I've not seen The image of a single upright man To be a marble consolation to us.		
A4047	O women, if we would compel the men To bow to Peace,		
A4048	We must refrain from every depth of love....		
A4049	Our sex is fitly food for Tragic Poets, Our whole life's but a pile of kisses apd babies.		
A4050	Peace maun be thought of first.		
A4051	Love's lack except wi' makeshifts.... But let it be. Peace maun be thought of first.		
A4052	But if—which heaven forbid—we should refrain As you would have us, how is Peace induced?		
A4053	That's our time! We'll disregard their knocking, beat them off— And they will soon be rabid for a Peace.		
A4054	Yield then, but with a sluggish, cold indifference. There is no joy to them in sullen mating.		
A4055	For us I ha' no doubt. We can persuade Our men to strike a fair an' decent Peace,		
A4056	We shall surprise the Acropolis today: That is the duty set the older dames.		
A4057	Set out the terms in detail And we'll a' swear to them.		
A4058	You, Calonice, repeat for the rest Each word I say. Then you must all take oath And pledge your arms to the same stern conditions—		
A4059	LYSISTRATA Do you all swear to this? MYRRHINE We do, we do.		
A4060	The women have appropriated the citadel. So, Lampito, dash off to your own land And raise the rebels there. These will serve as hostages, While we ourselves take our places in the ranks And drive the bolts right home.		
A4061	Shall light a fear in us; we will come out To Peace alone.		
A4062	The women whom at home we fed, Like witless fools, with fostering bread, Have impiously come to this— They've stolen the Acropolis, With bolts and bars our orders flout And shut us out.		
A4063	And the vile conspiratresses, plotters of such mischief dire, Pile and burn them all together in one vast and righteous pyre:		
A4064	Detested both of all the gods and of Euripides— Else, may the Marathon-plain not boast my trophied victories!		
A4065	You villainous old men, what's this you do? No honest man, no pious man, could do such things as you.		
A4066	A swarm of women sentinels to man the walls without.		
A4067	O hit them hard and hit again and hit until they run away, And perhaps they'll learn, like Bupalus, not to have too much to say.		
A4068	Now I appreciate Euripides' strange subtlety: Woman is the most shameless beast of all the beasts that be.		
A4069	I'm a free woman, I.		
A4070	Have the luxurious rites of the women glittered Their libertine show, their drumming tapped out crowds, The Sabazian Mysteries summoned their mob, Adonis been wept to death on the terraces, As I could hear the last day in the Assembly?		
A4071	I'm coming of my own accord.... Why bars? It is not bars we need but common sense.		
A4072	Indeed, you slut! Where is the archer now? Arrest this woman, tie her hands behind.		
A4073	You too! Where is that archer? Take that woman. I'll put a stop to these surprise-parties. STRATYLLIS By the Tauric Artemis, one inch nearer My fingers, and it's a bald man that'll be yelling.		
A4074	But surely women never can defeat us;		
A4075	To take first the treasury out of your management, and so stop the war through the absence of gold.		
A4076	Yes, why not? Of our capabilities you have had various clear evidences. Firstly remember we have always administered soundly the budget of all home-expenses.		
A4077	But we abolish war straight by our policy.		
A4078	Why do you women come prying and meddling in matters of state touching war-time and peace?		
A4079	All the long years when the hopeless war dragged along we, unassuming, forgotten in quiet, Endured without question, endured in our loneliness all your incessant child's antics and riot.		
A4080	I'd not be silent for any man living on earth, no, not I!		
A4081	To determine how husbands might yet back to wisdom despite their reluctance in time be compelled. Why then delay any longer? It's settled. For the future you'll take up our old occupation. Now in turn you're to hold tongue, as we did, and listen while we show the way to recover the nation.		
A4082	Earth I could brave with laughter, Having such wonderful girls here to friend. O the daring, the gracious, the beautiful ones! Their courage unswerving and witty Will rescue our city.		
A4083	O sprung from the seed of most valiant-wombed grand- mothers, scions of savage and dangerous nettles!		
A4084	Prepare for the battle, all. Gird up your angers. Our way the wind of sweet victory settles.		
A4085	I think that perhaps then they'll give us our title— Peace-makers.		
A4086	How, may I ask, will your rule re-establish order and justice in lands so tormented?		
A4087	So to untangle the War and its errors, ambassadors out on all sides we will send This way and that, here, there and round about—soon you will find that the War has an end.		
A4088	What of us then, who ever in vain for our children must weep Borne but to perish afar and in vain?		
A4089	Then while we should be companioned still merrily, happy as brides may, the livelong night, Kissing youth by, we are forced to lie single.... But leave for a moment our pitiful plight, It hurts even more to behold the poor maidens helpless wrinkling in staler virginity.		
A4090	Does not a man age? LYSISTRATA Not in the same way. Not as a woman grows withered, grows he. He, when returned from the war, though grey-headed, yet if he wishes can choose out a wife. But she has no solace save peering for omens, wretched and lonely the rest of her life.		
A4091	For is it not preposterous They should talk this way to us On a subject such as battle! And, women as they are, about bronze bucklers dare prattle—		
A4092	Some dirty game is up their sleeve, I believe. A Tyranny, no doubt... but they won't catch me, that know.		
A4093	It should not prejudice my voice that I'm not born a man, If I say something advantageous to the present situation.		
A4094	It should not prejudice my voice that I'm not born a man, If I say something advantageous to the present situation. For I'm taxed too, and as a toll provide men for the nation While, miserable greybeards, you, It is true, Contribute nothing of any importance whatever to our needs;		
A4095	For a man must strip to battle like a man. No quaking, brave steps taking, careless what's ahead, white shoed, in the nude, onward bold,		
A4096	Poor women, O so weak!		
A4097	You wicked women, cease from juggling lies. You want your men. But what of them as well? They toss as sleepless in the lonely night, I'm sure of it.		
A4098	An oracle has promised Victory If we don't wrangle. Would you hear the words?		
A4099	But though he reared this hate for men, He loved the women even then, And never thought them enemies.		
A4100	MYRRHINE I certainly pity him with so heartless a father. CINESIAS Come down, my sweetest, come for the child's sake.		
A4101	What human being could sustain This unforeseen domestic strain, And not a single trace Of willing women in the place!		
A4102	Wi' lightest neif skim their primsie pretties Till we've concluded Peace-terms wi' a' Hellas. MAGISTRATE So the conspiracy is universal;		
A4103	Then return to Sparta. Bid them Send envoys with full powers to treat of Peace; And I will urge the Senate here to choose Plenipotentiary ambassadors, As argument adducing this connection.		
A4104	There is no beast, no rush of fire, like woman so untamed. She calmly goes her way where even panthers would be shamed.		
A4105	WOMEN And yet you are fool enough, it seems, to dare to war with me, When for your faithful ally you might win me easily. MEN Never could the hate I feel for womankind grow less.		
A4106	Now you look sensible, and that you're men no one could doubt. If you were but good friends again, I'd take the insect out That hurts your eye.		
A4107	O botheration take you all! How you cajole and flatter. A hell it is to live with you; to live without, a hell:		
A4108	But come, these enmities let's quell. You stop from giving orders and I'll stop from doing wrong.		
A4109	There's only one condition made (Indulge my whim in this I pray)— When Peace is signed once more, On no account am I to be repaid.		
A4110	But on the contrary to promote good feeling in the state By word and deed. We've had enough calamities of late. So let a man or woman but divulge		
A4111	Unless Peace is soon declared, we shall be driven In the void of women to try Cleisthenes.		
A4112	Let us callout Lysistrata Since she alone can settle the Peace-terms.		
A4113	Hail, Wonder of all women! Now you must be in turn Hard, shifting, clear, deceitful, noble, crafty, sweet, and stern. The foremost men of Hellas, smitten by your fascination, Have brought their tangled quarrels here for your sole arbitration.		
A4114	I am a woman, but I'm not a fool. And what of natural intelligence I own Has been filled out with the remembered precepts My father and the city-elders taught me.		
A4115	The altars common to all Hellenes, yet You wrack Hellenic cities, bloody Hellas With deaths of her own sons, while yonder clangs The gathering menace of barbarians.		
A4116	I've never seen a nobler woman anywhere.		
A4117	Now, brethren twined with mutual benefactions, Can you still war, can you suffer such disgrace? Why not be friends? What is there to prevent you?		
A4118	There's no distinction in our politics: We've risen as one man to this conclusion;		
A4119	Earth is delighted now, peace is the voice of earth.		
A4120	Spartans, sort out your wives: Athenians, yours. Let each catch hands with his wife and dance his joy,		
A4121	And all the Daimons summon hither to be Witnesses of our revelry And of the noble Peace we have made, Aphrodite our aid.		
A4122	These are the very armaments of the rescue. These crocus-gowns, this outlay of the best myrrh, Slippers, cosmetics dusting beauty, and robes With rippling creases of light.		
A4123	MYRRHINE No, I won't do it. Let the war proceed. CALONICE No, I won't do it. Let the war proceed.		
A4124	Here now, share fair, haven't we made a pact?		
A4125	O Goddess, suffer not, I pray, this harsh deed to be done, But show us Greece and Athens with their warlike acts repealed!		
A4126	How may this ferocity be tamed? It grows too great to bear.		
A4127	Yes, gold caused it and miseries more, too many to be told.		
A4128	All who inside Athens' walls have their dwelling into one great common basket we'll pack. Disenfranchised or citizens, allies or aliens, pell-mell the lot of them in we will squeeze. Till they discover humanity's meaning...		
A4129	Each portion we'll take and wind in to this centre, inward to Athens each loyalty pull, Till from the vast heap where all's piled together at last can be woven a strong Cloak of State.		
A4130	Now by all the gods We must let no agony deter from duty, Back to your quarters. For we are base indeed, My friends, if we betray the oracle.		
A4131	We come to treat o' Peace. ATHENIANS Well spoken there! And we the same. Let us callout Lysistrata Since she alone can settle the Peace-terms.		
A4132	ATHENIANS I want to strip at once and plough my land. SPARTANS And mine I want to fertilize at once. LYSISTRATA And so you can, when Peace is once declared.		
A4133	I agree with all of you. Now off, and cleanse yourselves for the Acropolis, For we invite you all in to a supper From our commissariat baskets.		
A4134	You will pledge good behaviour and uprightness; Then each man's wife is his to hustle home.		
A4135	When we are warm with wine, how wise we grow.		
A4136	But now we're charmed with each other. They might cap With the Telamon-catch instead of the Cleitagora, And we'd applaud and praise them just the same; We're not too scrupulous in weighing words.		
A4137	Come, Hunting Girl, an' hear my prayer— You whose arrows whizz in woodlands, come an' bless This Peace we swear.		
A4138	Dance out his thanks, be grateful in music, And promise reformation with his heels.		
A4139	That's only fair, since sober we're such fools:		
A4140	Lead thou the dance, gather thy joyous tresses up i' bands An' play like a fawn. To madden them, clap thy hands, And sing praise to the warrior goddess templed i' our lands, Her o' the House o' Brass.		
A4141	Let us be fenced wi' age long amity, O let this bond stick ever firm through thee In friendly happiness.		
A4142	Their stirring love will rise up furiously, They'll beg our arms to open. That's our time! We'll disregard their knocking, beat them off— And they will soon be rabid for a Peace.		
A4143	The women have appropriated the citadel. So, Lampito, dash off to your own land And raise the rebels there.		
A4144	For always at home you continued discussing the war and its politics loudly, and we Sometimes would ask you, our hearts deep with sorrowing though we spoke lightly, though happy to see, “What's to be inscribed on the side of the Treaty-stone What, dear, was said in the Assembly today?” “Mind your own business,” he'd answer me growlingly “hold your tongue, woman, or else go away.” And so I would hold it.		
A4145	Both hearken to my words. I am a woman, but I'm not a fool. And what of natural intelligence I own Has been filled out with the remembered precepts My father and the city-elders taught me.		
A4146	First I reproach you both sides equally		
A4147	It's hard for women, you know, To get away. There's so much to do; Husbands to be patted and put in good tempers:		
A4148	children washed Or soothed with lullays or fed with mouthfuls of pap.		
A4149	If that was the case, they'd soon come fluttering along.		
A4150	So fine it comes to this—Greece saved by Woman! CALONICE By Woman? Wretched thing, I'm sorry for it. LYSISTRATA Our country's fate is henceforth in our hands:		
A4151	Now will you help me, if I find a means To stamp the war out.		
A4152	And half is hackt off as the price of peace.		
A4153	And I too! Why, to get a peep at the shy thing I'd clamber up to the tip-top o' Taygetus.		
A4154	Then I'll expose my mighty mystery. O women, if we would compel the men To bow to Peace, we must refrain—		
A4155	We must refrain from every depth of love...		
A4156	No, I won't do it. Let the war proceed.		
A4157	Lewd to the least drop in the tiniest vein, Our sex is fitly food for Tragic Poets, Our whole life's but a pile of kisses apd babies.		
A4158	But, hardy Spartan, if you join with me All may be righted yet. O help me, help me.		
A4159	But let it be. Peace maun be thought of first.		
A4160	My friend, my friend! The only one amid this herd of weaklings.		
A4161	By the two Goddesses, now can't you see All we have to do is idly sit indoors With smooth roses powdered on our cheeks, Our bodies burning naked through the folds Of shining Amorgos' silk, and meet the men With our dear Venus-plats plucked trim and neat. Their stirring love will rise up furiously,		
A4162	They'll beg our arms to open. That's our time! We'll disregard their knocking, beat them off—		
A4163	But if they should force us? LYSISTRATA Yield then, but with a sluggish, cold indifference. There is no joy to them in sullen mating. Besides we have other ways to madden them; They cannot stand up long, and they've no delight Unless we fit their aim with merry succour.		
A4164	SO, grasp the brim, you, Lampito, and all. You, Calonice, repeat for the rest Each word I say. Then you must all take oath And pledge your arms to the same stern conditions—		
A4165	Do you all swear to this? MYRRHINE We do, we do. LYSISTRATA Then I shall immolate the victim thus. She drinks.		
A4166	As I told you, The women have appropriated the citadel.		
A4167	And the vile conspiratresses, plotters of such mischief dire, Pile and burn them all together in one vast and righteous pyre: Fling with our own hands Lycon's wife to fry in the thickest fire		
A4168	If they refuse to draw the bolts in immediate compliance, We'll set fire to the wood, and smoke will strangle their defiance.		
A4169	Henceforth you'll serve in no more juries.		
A4170	Have the luxurious rites of the women glittered Their libertine show, their drumming tapped out crowds, The Sabazian Mysteries summoned their mob, Adonis been wept to death on the terraces,		
A4171	Come, force the gates with crowbars, prise them apart! I'll prise away myself too.... (LYSISTRATA appears.) LYSISTRATA Stop this banging. I'm coming of my own accord.... Why bars? It is not bars we need but common sense.		
A4172	MAGISTRATE Indeed, you slut! Where is the archer now? Arrest this woman, tie her hands behind. LYSISTRATA If he brushes me with a finger, by Artemis, The public menial, he'll be sorry for it.		
A4173	On, gallant allies of our high design, Vendors of grain-eggs-pulse-and-vegetables, Ye garlic-tavern-keepers of bakeries, Strike, batter, knock, hit, slap, and scratch our foes, Be finely imprudent, say what you think of them....		
A4174	Enough! retire and do not rob the dead.		
A4175	Still if you wake a wasps' nest then of wasps you must beware.		
A4176	If you should do the same again, I'll punch you in the eye.		
A4177	Is gold then the cause of the war?		
A4178	Yes, gold caused it and miseries more, too many to be told. 'Twas for money, and money alone, that Pisander with all of the army of mob-agitators. Raised up revolutions. But, as for the future, it won't be worth while to set up to be traitors.		
A4179	Be calm then and I'll go ahead.		
A4180	Sometimes would ask you, our hearts deep with sorrowing though we spoke lightly, though happy to see, “What's to be inscribed on the side of the Treaty-stone What, dear, was said in the Assembly today?” “Mind your own business,” he'd answer me growlingly “hold your tongue, woman, or else go away.” And so I would hold it.		
A4181	For always at home you continued discussing the war and its politics loudly, and we		
A4182	All the long years when the hopeless war dragged along we, unassuming, forgotten in quiet, Endured without question, endured in our loneliness all your incessant child's antics and riot. Our lips we kept tied, though aching with silence, though well all the while in our silence we knew How wretchedly everything still was progressing by listening dumbly the day long to you.		
A4183	At once a convention of all wives through Hellas here for a serious purpose was held, To determine how husbands might yet back to wisdom despite their reluctance in time be compelled. Why then delay any longer? It's settled. For the future you'll take up our old occupation. Now in turn you're to hold tongue, as we did, and listen while we show the way to recover the nation.		
A4184	In our comradely venture Each taking her due part.		
A4185	soon you will find that the War has an end.		
A4186	So to untangle the War and its errors, ambassadors out on all sides we will send This way and that, here, there and round about		
A4187	All who inside Athens' walls have their dwelling into one great common basket we'll pack. Disenfranchised or citizens, allies or aliens, pell-mell the lot of them in we will squeeze. Till they discover humanity's meaning..		
A4188	Through the whole city for all greasy fellows; burrs too, the parasites, off we will rub. That verminous plague of insensate place-seekers soon between thumb and forefinger we'll crack.		
A4189	Does not a man age?		
A4190	Not in the same way. Not as a woman grows withered, grows he. He, when returned from the war, though grey-headed, yet if he wishes can choose out a wife. But she has no solace save peering for omens, wretched and lonely the rest of her life.		
A4191	Some dirty game is up their sleeve, I believe. A Tyranny, no doubt...		
A4192	They mean to put us under Themselves I suspect, And that Laconians assembling At Cleisthenes' house have played A trick-of-war and provoked them Madly to raid The Treasury, in which term I include The Pay for my food.		
A4193	Every silly old-man threat While Lampito's with me. Or dear Ismenia, the noble Theban girl.		
A4194	You wicked women, cease from juggling lies. You want your men. But what of them as well? They toss as sleepless in the lonely night,		
A4195	For we are base indeed, My friends, if we betray the oracle.		
A4196	I love him O so much! but he won't have it.		
A4197	MYRRHINE I certainly pity him with so heartless a father. CINESIAS Come down, my sweetest, come for the child's sake. MYRRHINE A trying life it is to be a mother!		
A4198	Not till a treaty finishes the war.		
A4199	With sympathy your case I view;		
A4200	She did it all, the harlot, she With her atrocious harlotry.		
A4201	Then return to Sparta. Bid them Send envoys with full powers to treat of Peace; And I will urge the Senate here to choose Plenipotentiary ambassadors, As argument adducing this connection		
A4202	Please squeeze it out, and show me what it is that makes this sting. It's been paining me a long while now. WOMEN Well I'll agree to that, Although you're most unmannerly. O what a giant gnat. Here, look! It comes from marshy Tricorysus, I can tell. MEN O thank you. It was digging out a veritable well. Now that it's gone, I can't hold back my tears. See how they fall. WOMEN I'll wipe them off, bad as you are, and kiss you after all.		
A4203	O botheration take you all! How you cajole and flatter. A hell it is to live with you; to live without, a hell: How truly was that said.		
A4204	There's only one condition made (Indulge my whim in this I pray)— When Peace is signed once more		
A4205	Hail, Wonder of all women! Now you must be in turn Hard, shifting, clear, deceitful, noble, crafty, sweet, and stern. The foremost men of Hellas, smitten by your fascination, Have brought their tangled quarrels here for your sole arbitration. LYSISTRATA		
A4206	An easy task if the love's raging home-sickness Doesn't start trying out how well each other Will serve instead of us		
A4207	Then with four thousand hoplites Cimon marched And saved all Sparta.		
A4208	They alone stood by your shoulder on that day. They freed you, so that for the slave's short skirt You should wear the trailing cloak of libert		
A4209	I want to strip at once and plough my land. SPARTANS And mine I want to fertilize at once. LYSISTRATA And so you can, when Peace is once declared		
A4210	This is the advice I'd give the Athenians— See our ambassadors are always drunk. For when we visit Sparta sober, then We're on the alert for trickery all the while So that we miss half of the things they say, And misinterpret things that were never said, And then report the muddle back to Athens. But now we're charmed with each other. They might cap With the Telamon-catch instead of the Cleitagora, And we'd applaud and praise them just the same; We're not too scrupulous in weighing words.		
A4211	Let each catch hands with his wife and dance his joy, Dance out his thanks, be grateful in music		
A4212	Spartans, sort out your wives: Athenians, yours.		
A4213	And promise reformation with his heels.		
A4214	My dear, they'll come. It's hard for women, you know, To get away. There's so much to do;		
A4215	By Woman? Wretched thing, I'm sorry for it.		
A4216	The image of a single upright man To be a marble consolation to us.		
A4217	the price of peace.		
A4218	O women, if we would compel the men To bow to Peace, we must refrain—		
A4219	Then I'll expose my mighty mystery.		
A4220	By the two Goddesses, now can't you see All we have to do is idly sit indoors With smooth roses powdered on our cheeks, Our bodies burning naked through the folds Of shining Amorgos' silk, and meet the men With our dear Venus-plats plucked trim and neat. Their stirring love will rise up furiously, They'll beg our arms to open. That's our time! We'll disregard their knocking, beat them off— And they will soon be rabid for a Peace. I'm sure of it.		
A4221	By the two Goddesses, now can't you see All we have to do is idly sit indoors With smooth roses powdered on our cheeks, Our bodies burning naked through the folds Of shining Amorgos' silk, and meet the men With our dear Venus-plats plucked trim and neat.		
A4222	Well if you must have it so, we'll all agree.		
A4223	Do you all swear to this?		
A4224	We do, we do.		
A4225	Greece and Athens with their warlike acts repealed!		
A4226	No honest man, no pious man, could do such things as you.		
A4227	It is not bars we need but common sense.		
A4228	If he brushes me with a finger, by Artemis, The public menial, he'll be sorry for it.		
A4229	f you should do the same again, I'll punch you in the eye.		
A4230	Now in turn you're to hold tongue, as we did, and listen while we show the way to recover the nation.		
A4231	All who inside Athens' walls have their dwelling into one great common basket we'll pack. Disenfranchised or citizens, allies or aliens, pell-mell the lot of them in we will squeeze. Till they discover humanity's meaning....		
A4232	For a man must strip to battle like a man.		
A4233	O 'tis our naughty femininity, So weak in one spot, that hath saddened me.		
A4234	You wicked women, cease from juggling lies. You want your men. But what of them as well? They toss as sleepless in the lonely night, I'm sure of it. Hold out awhile, hold out,		
A4235	A trying life it is to be a mother!		
A4236	I'm dead: the woman's worn me all away.		
A4237	Wi' lightest neif skim their primsie pretties Till we've concluded Peace-terms wi' a' Hellas.		
A4238	Bid them Send envoys with full powers to treat of Peace;		
A4239	O botheration take you all! How you cajole and flatter. A hell it is to live with you; to live without, a hell: How truly was that said. But come, these enmities let's quell.		
A4240	We come to treat o' Peace.		
A4241	Well spoken there! And we the same. Let us callout Lysistrata Since she alone can settle the Peace-terms.		
A4242	An easy task if the love's raging home-sickness Doesn't start trying out how well each other Will serve instead of us.		
A4243	And so you can, when Peace is once declared.		
A4244	And of the noble Peace we have made,		
A4245	Happy Hera, Queen of all, And all the Daimons summon hither to be Witnesses of our revelry And of the noble Peace we have made, Aphrodite our aid.		
A4246	Oh! Zeus, what art thou going to do for our people? Dost thou not see this, that our cities will soon be but empty husks?		
A4247	I want to ask him what he reckons to do for all the Greeks. First Servant And if he doesn't tell you? Trygaeus I shall pursue him at law as a traitor who sells Greece to the Medes.		
A4248	You hurt me too sorely, my daughters, when you ask me for bread, calling me your daddy, and there is not the ghost of an obolus in the house; if I succeed and come back, you will have a barley loaf every morning —and a punch in the eye for sauce!		
A4249	Because of their wrath against the Greeks. They have located War in the house they occupied themselves and have given him full power to do with you exactly as he pleases; then they went as high up as ever they could, so as to see no more of your fights and to hear no more of your prayers.		
A4250	Trygaeus And why have the gods moved away? Hermes Because of their wrath against the Greeks. They have located War in the house they occupied themselves and have given him full power to do with you exactly as he pleases; then they went as high up as ever they could, so as to see no more of your fights and to hear no more of your prayers.		
A4251	Because they have afforded you an opportunity for peace more than once, but you have always preferred war.		
A4252	If the Laconians got the very slightest advantage, they would exclaim, “By the Twin Brethren! the Athenians shall smart for this.” If, on the contrary, the latter triumphed and the Laconians came with peace proposals, you would say, “By Demeter, they want to deceive us. No, by Zeus, we will not hear a word; they will always be coming as long as we hold Pylos.”		
A4253	Oh, what misery the very sight of War causes me! This then is the foe from whom I fly, who is so cruel, so formidable, so stalwart, so solid on his legs!		
A4254	See the danger that threatens if he returns with the pestle, for War will quietly amuse himself with pounding all the towns of Hellas to pieces.		
A4255	Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when freed of quarrels and fighting, we should rescue sweet Peace and draw her out of this pit, before some other pestle prevents us		
A4256	Come, laborers, merchants, workmen, artisans, strangers,  whether you be domiciled or not, islanders— Come here, Greeks of all countries, come hurrying here with picks and levers and ropes!This is the moment to drain a cup in honor of the Good Genius.		
A4257	All peoples of Greece, now is the time or never, for you to help each other.		
A4258	All peoples of Greece, now is the time or never, for you to help each other. You see yourselves freed from battles and all their horrors of bloodshed.		
A4259	Give your orders, direct us, for I swear to work this day without ceasing, until with the help of our levers and our engines we have drawn back into light the greatest of all goddesses, her to whom the olive is so dear.		
A4260	Once we have hold of her, none in the world will be able to take her from us.		
A4261	I am so happy, so delighted at not having to carry my buckler any more. I fart for joy and I laugh more than if I had cast my old age, as a serpent does its skin.		
A4262	But when you have got the goddess, Then rejoice, shout and laugh; thenceforward you will be able to sail or stay at home, to make love or sleep, to attend festivals and processions, to play at cottabos, live like true Sybarites and to shout, Io, io!		
A4263	Ah! God grant we may see the blessed day. I have suffered so much; have so oft slept with Phormio on hard beds. You will no longer find me a bitter and angry judge, nor, naturally, hard in my ways, as heretofore, but turned indulgent and grown younger by twenty years through happiness. We have been killing ourselves long enough, tiring ourselves out with going to the Lyceum and returning laden with spear and buckler.		
A4264	Be not pitiless toward our prayers; permit us to deliver the goddess. Oh! the most human, the most generous of the gods, be favourable toward us, if it be true that you detest the haughty crests and proud brows of Pisander; we shall never cease, oh master, offering you sacred victims and solemn prayers.		
A4265	Because it is to you that we sacrifice, whereas the barbarians worship them; hence they would like to see you destroyed, that they alone might receive the offerings.		
A4266	So therefore, Hermes, my friend, help us with your whole heart to find and deliver the captive and we will celebrate the great Panathenaea in your honor as well as all the festivals of the other gods; for Hermes shall be the Mysteries, the Dipolia, the Adonia; everywhere the towns, freed from their miseries, will sacrifice to Hermes the Liberator;		
A4267	Come, come, there is no working together. Come! all pull at the same instant!		
A4268	Come! all together! Everyone to the work and with a good heart for the business.		
A4269	Isn't it terrible and stupid! some pull one way and others another. You Argives there, beware of a thrashing!		
A4270	Come then, all together! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! All together!		
A4271	Chorus Come then, all together! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! All together! Peace is drawn out of the pit. With her come Opora and Theoria.		
A4272	Ah! venerated goddess, who givest us our grapes, where am I to find the ten-thousand-gallon words wherewith to greet thee? I have none such at home. Oh! hail to thee, Opora, and thee, Theoria! How beautiful is thy face! How sweet thy breath! What gentle fragrance comes from thy bosom, gentle as freedom from military duty, as the most dainty perfumes!		
A4273	Let the husbandmen take their farming tools and return to their fields as quickly as possible, but without either sword, spear or javelin. All is as quiet as if Peace had been reigning for a century.		
A4274	Oh, thou, whom men of standing desired and who art good to husbandmen, I have gazed upon thee with delight; and now I go to greet my vines, to caress after so long an absence the fig trees I planted in my youth.		
A4275	Friends, do you remember the happy life that Peace afforded us formerly; can you recall the splendid baskets of figs, both fresh and dried, the myrtles, the sweet wine, the violets blooming near the spring, and the olives, for which we have wept so much? Worship, adore the goddess for restoring you so many blessings.		
A4276	Moreover it's not obscure private persons or women that he stages in his comedies; but, bold as Heracles, it's the very greatest whom he attacks, undeterred by the fetid stink of leather or the threats of hearts of mud.		
A4277	Hence both grown men and youths should be on my side and I likewise invite the bald to give me their votes; for, if I triumph, everyone will say, both at table and at festivals, “Carry this to the bald man, give these cakes to the bald one, do not grudge the poet whose talent shines as bright as his own bare skull the share he deserves.”		
A4278	Come, who wishes to take the charge of her? No one? Come, Theoria, I am going to lead you into the midst of the spectators and confide you to their care.		
A4279	Such a man as you assures the happiness of all his fellow-citizens.		
A4280	How everything succeeds to our wish, when the gods are willing and Fortune favours us! how opportunely everything falls out.		
A4281	Oh! Peace, mighty queen, venerated goddess, thou, who presidest over choruses and at nuptials, deign to accept the sacrifices we offer thee.		
A4282	Put an end to this tittle-tattle, to this idle babble, that set us defying one another. Cause the Greeks once more to taste the pleasant beverage of friendship and temper all hearts with the gentle feeling of forgiveness.		
A4283	Oh! joy, joy! no more helmet, no more cheese nor onions!No, I have no passion for battles; what I love is to drink with good comrades in the corner by the fire when good dry wood, cut in the height of the summer, is crackling; it is to cook pease on the coals and beechnuts among the embers, it is to kiss our pretty Thracian while my wife is at the bath.		
A4284	Come, wife, to the fields and seek, my beauty, to brighten and enliven my nights. First Half Chorus Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!		
A4285	Come, wife, to the fields and seek, my beauty, to brighten and enliven my nights.		
A4286	As for me, I will explain the matter to you all, children, youths, grown-ups and old men, aye, even to the decrepit dotards.		
A4287	My master is mad, not as you are, but with another sort of madness, quite a new kind.		
A4288	“Ah! Zeus,” he cries, “what are thy intentions? Lay aside thy besom; do not sweep Greece away!” Ah! Hush, hush! I think I hear his voice!		
A4289	But what is my master doing? I must stoop down to look through this hole. Oh! great gods! Here! neighbors, run here quick! here is my master flying off mounted on his beetle as if on horseback.		
A4290	'Tis for the weal of all the Greeks; I am attempting a daring and novel feat.		
A4291	I shall pursue him at law as a traitor who sells Greece to the Medes.		
A4292	Yes, I am going. You hurt me too sorely, my daughters, when you ask me for bread, calling me your daddy, and there is not the ghost of an obolus in the house; if I succeed and come back, you will have a barley loaf every morning —and a punch in the eye for sauce!		
A4293	Take care not to knock against anything and so fall off into space; once a cripple, you would be a fit subject for Euripides, who would put you into a tragedy.		
A4294	Tell me, what is War preparing against us? Hermes All I know is that last evening he brought along a huge mortar. Trygaeus And what is he going to do with his mortar? Hermes He wants to pound up all the cities of Greece in it....		
A4295	If there be a citizen, greedy for military rank and honors, who refuses, oh, divine Peace! to restore you to daylight— Chorus May he behave as cowardly as Cleonymus on the battlefield.		
A4296	If some ambitious man does not help us, because he wants to become a General, or if a slave is plotting to pass over to the enemy— Chorus Let his limbs be broken on the wheel, may he be beaten to death with rods!		
A4297	Off to the Devil with you, Megarians! The goddess hates you. She recollects that you were the first to rub her the wrong way. Athenians, you are not well placed for pulling. There you are too busy with law-suits; if you really want to free the goddess, get down a little towards the sea.		
A4298	Come then, come, and all together!		
A4299	Hail! hail! thou beloved divinity! thy return overwhelms us with joy. When far from thee, my ardent wish to see my fields again made me pine with regret. From thee came all blessings. Oh! much desired Peace! thou art the sole support of those who spend their lives tilling the earth.		
A4300	She says, that after the affair of Pylos she came to you unbidden to bring you a basket full of truces and that you thrice repulsed her by your votes in the assembly. Trygaeus Yes, we did wrong, but forgive us, for our mind was then entirely absorbed in leather.		
A4301	Undoubtedly the comic poet who mounted the stage to praise himself in the parabasis would deserve to be handed over to the sticks of the beadles. Nevertheless, oh Muse, if it be right to esteem the most honest and illustrious of our comic writers at his proper value, permit our poet to say that he thinks he has deserved a glorious renown.		
A4302	Pericles feared he might share his ill-luck, he mistrusted your peevish nature and, to prevent all danger to himself, he threw out that little spark, the Megarian decree, set the city aflame, and blew up the conflagration with a hurricane of war, so that the smoke drew tears from all Greeks both here and over there		
A4303	They, being as shamelessly greedy as they were faithless in diplomacy, chased off Peace with ignominy to let loose War.		
A4304	So the strangers, seeing what terrible blows the informers dealt, sealed their lips with gold. They grew rich, while you, alas! you could only see that Greece was going to ruin.		
A4305	After having delivered us from all these wearisome ineptitudes and these low buffooneries, he has built up for us a great art, like a palace with high towers, constructed of fine phrases, great thoughts and of jokes not common on the streets.		
A4306	but I took all my theatrical gear and returned straight home. I pained folk but little and caused them much amusement; my conscience rebuked me for nothing.		
A4307	I did not recoil in horror at the sight of such a monster, but fought him relentlessly to win your deliverance and that of the islanders.” Such are the services which should be graven in your recollection and entitle me to your thanks.		
A4308	Such are the songs with which the Muse with the glorious hair inspires the able poet and which enchant the assembled populace, when the spring swallow twitters beneath the foliage;		
A4309	E'en from to-day we hail you as the deliverer of mankind.		
A4310	Excepting the gods, there is none greater than yourself, and that will ever be our opinion.		
A4311	Blood cannot please Peace, so let us spill none upon her altar.		
A4312	You have braved a thousand dangers to save your sacred town. All honor to you! your glory will be ever envied.		
A4313	Don't talk, for it is divine Peace to whom we are sacrificing.		
A4314	What! you are so ignorant you don't understand the will of the gods and you make a treaty, you, who are men, with apes, who are full of malice?		
A4315	Then what should be done? Not to stop War would be to leave it to the decision of chance which of the two people should suffer the most, whereas by uniting under a treaty, we share the empire of Greece.		
A4316	Trygaeus Then what should be done? Not to stop War would be to leave it to the decision of chance which of the two people should suffer the most, whereas by uniting under a treaty, we share the empire of Greece.		
A4317	Wise Homer has also said: “He who delights in the horrors of civil war has neither country nor laws nor home.” What noble words!		
A4318	And all of you, who yesterday were dying of hunger, come, stuff yourselves with this fine hare-stew; it's not every day that we find cakes lying neglected.Eat, eat, or I predict you will soon regret it.		
A4319	But come, comrades, we who are in the first row, let us pick up the bridegroom and carry him in triumph.		
A4320	Chorus Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus! Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!  Trygaeus Hail, hail, my friends. All who come with me shall have cakes galore.		
A4321	Oh! thrice happy man, who so well deserve your good fortune!		
A4322	You, who remain to the feast, it's your duty to devour dish after dish and not to ply empty jaws. Come, put heart into the work and eat with your mouths full. For, believe me, poor friends, white teeth are useless furniture if they chew nothing.		
A4323	What an unhappy fate, great gods, to be the slave of a fool!		
A4324	What an unhappy fate, great gods, to be the slave of a fool! A servant may give the best of advice, but if his master does not follow it, the poor slave must inevitably have his share in the disaster; for fortune does not allow him to dispose of his own body, it belongs to his master who has bought it.		
A4325	What an unhappy fate, great gods, to be the slave of a fool! A servant may give the best of advice, but if his master does not follow it, the poor slave must inevitably have his share in the disaster; for fortune does not allow him to dispose of his own body, it belongs to his master who has bought it. Alas! 'tis the way of the world.		
A4326	But the god, Apollo,in tragic style  whose oracles the Pythian priestess on her golden tripod makes known to us, deserves my censure, for surely he is a physician and a cunning diviner;		
A4327	I honored the gods and did what was right, and yet I was none the less poor and unfortunate.		
A4328	Others amassed wealth —the sacrilegious, the demagogues, the informers, indeed every sort of rascal.		
A4329	Therefore I came to consult the oracle of the god, not on my own account, for my unfortunate life is nearing its end, but for my only son; I wanted to ask Apollo if it was necessary for him to become a thorough knave and renounce his virtuous principles, since that seemed to me to be the only way to succeed in life.		
A4330	Is it not evident to the blind, that nowadays to do nothing that is right is the best way to get on?		
A4331	nowadays to do nothing that is right is the best way to get on?		
A4332	Zeus inflicted it on me, because of his jealousy of mankind		
A4333	When I was young, I threatened him that I would only go to the just, the wise, the men of ordered life; to prevent my distinguishing these, he struck me with blindness! so much does he envy the good!		
A4334	Oh! I adjure you, believe what I say and don't leave me; for you will seek in vain for a more honest man than myself. Cario There is only one man more worthy; and that is I. Plutus All talk like this, but as soon as they secure my favours and grow rich, their wickedness knows no bounds.		
A4335	And yet all men are not wicked. Plutus All. There's no exception.		
A4336	If you were mad enough to cure me, and Zeus heard of it, he would overwhelm me with his anger.		
A4337	For instance, what is the basis of the power that Zeus wields over the other gods? Cario Money; he has so much of it.		
A4338	Undoubtedly, for it's wealth that all demand and clamor most loudly for.		
A4339	Thus it's Plutus who is the fount of all the honors rendered to Zeus, whose worship he can wither up at the root, if it so pleases him.		
A4340	Whatever is dazzling, beautiful or charming in the eyes of mankind, comes from you. Does not everything depend on wealth?		
A4341	It's the same with the lads; they care not for love, to them money means everything.		
A4342	In short, Plutus, it is through you that everything is done; you must realize that you are the sole cause both of good and evil.		
A4343	If a man has thirteen talents, he has all the greater ardor to possess sixteen; if that wish is achieved, he will want forty or will complain that he knows not how to make both ends meet.		
A4344	Ah! they were quite right who said there's nothing more timorous than Plutus.		
A4345	I don't at all like going into other folks' houses in this manner; I have never got any good from it. If I got inside a miser's house, straightway he would bury me deep underground; if some honest fellow among his friends came to ask him for the smallest coin, he would deny ever having seen me. Then if I went to a fool's house, he would sacrifice in dicing and wenching, and very soon I should be completely stripped and pitched out of doors.		
A4346	moderation is the strong point in my character. I love saving as much as anybody, and I know how to spend, when it's needed.		
A4347	That's because you have never met a man who knew how to avoid the two extremes; moderation is the strong point in my character. I love saving as much as anybody, and I know how to spend, when it's needed.		
A4348	My master is going to drag you all out of the stupid, sapless life you are leading and ensure you one full of all delights.		
A4349	Friends, it's Plutus whom my master brings, Plutus, who will give you riches.		
A4350	What!we jostle each other at the Assembly for three obols, and am I going to let Plutus in person be stolen from me?		
A4351	It's a bad business, and one that doesn't please me! To grow rich all at once and yet to be fearful! ah! I suspect something that's little good.		
A4352	But I have thought the matter well over, and the best thing is to make Plutus lie in the Temple of Asclepius. Blepsidemus Unquestionably that's the very best thing. Hurry and lead him away to the temple.		
A4353	Unwise, perverse, unholy men! What are you daring to do, you pitiful, wretched mortals?		
A4354	My arm shall destroy you, you infamous beings! Such an attempt is not to be borne; neither man nor god has ever dared the like. You shall die!		
A4355	Poverty I am one that will punish you this very day for having wanted to make me disappear from here.		
A4356	it's Poverty, the most fearful monster that ever drew breath.		
A4357	I am the sole cause of all your blessings, and that your safety depends on me alone.		
A4358	gree to hear me and I think it will be very easy for me to prove that you are entirely on the wrong road, when you want to make the just men wealthy.		
A4359	It is right that the good should be happy, that the wicked and the impious, on the other hand, should be miserable; that is a truth, I believe, which no one will gainsay. To realize this condition of things is a proposal as great as it is noble and useful in every respect, and we have found a means of attaining the object of our wishes. If Plutus recovers his sight and ceases from wandering about unseeing and at random, he will go to seek the just men and never leave them again; he will shun the perverse and ungodly; so, thanks to him, all men will become honest, rich and pious. Can anything better be conceived for the public weal?		
A4360	It is right that the good should be happy, that the wicked and the impious, on the other hand, should be miserable; that is a truth, I believe, which no one will gainsay		
A4361	If Plutus recovers his sight and ceases from wandering about unseeing and at random, he will go to seek the just men and never leave them again; he will shun the perverse and ungodly; so, thanks to him, all men will become honest, rich and pious		
A4362	Does it not seem that everything is extravagance in the world, or rather madness, when you watch the way things go? A crowd of rogues enjoy blessings they have won by sheer injustice, while more honest folks are miserable, die of hunger, and spend their whole lives with you		
A4363	Now, if Plutus became clear-sighted again and drove out Poverty, it would be the greatest blessing possible for the human race.		
A4364	Let Plutus recover his sight and divide his favours out equally to all, and none will ply either trade or art any longer; all toil would be done away with.		
A4365	Let Plutus recover his sight and divide his favours out equally to all, and none will ply either trade or art any longer; all toil would be done away with. Who would wish to hammer iron, build ships, sew, turn, cut up leather, bake bricks, bleach linen, tan hides, or break up the soil of the earth with the plough and garner the gifts of Demeter, if he could live in idleness and free from all this work?		
A4366	But if your system is applied, there won't be a single slave-dealer left. What rich man would risk his life to devote himself to this traffic? You will have to toil, to dig and submit yourself to all kinds of hard labour; so that your life would be more wretched even than it is now.		
A4367	The poor man lives thriftily and attentive to his work; he has not got too much, but he does not lack what he really needs.		
A4368	But what you don't know is this, that men with me are worth more, both in mind and body, than with Plutus. With him they are gouty, big-bellied, heavy of limb and scandalously stout; with me they are thin, wasp-waisted, and terrible to the foe.		
A4369	Look at the orators in our republics; as long as they are poor, both state and people can only praise their uprightness; but once they are fattened on the public funds, they conceive a hatred for justice, plan intrigues against the people and attack the democracy.		
A4370	Chremylus Then tell me this, why does all mankind flee from you? Poverty Because I make them better. Children do the very same; they flee from the wise counsels of their fathers. So difficult is it to see one's true interest.		
A4371	But wealth coupled to such sordid greed is yet more shameful than poverty.		
A4372	Ask Hecate whether it is better to be rich or starving; she will tell you that the rich send her a meal every month and that the poor make it disappear before it is even served.		
A4373	What joy for my master and even more for Plutus! The god has regained his sight; his eyes sparkle with the greatest brilliancy, thanks to the benevolent care of Asclepius.		
A4374	I will sing to the honor of Asclepius, the son of illustrious Zeus, with a resounding voice; he is the beneficent star which men adore.		
A4375	Neoclides shrieked, howled, sprang towards the foot of his bed and wanted to bolt, but the god laughed and said to him, “Keep where you are with your salve; by doing this you will not go and perjure yourself before the Assembly.”		
A4376	As for myself, I did not cease thanking the god who had so quickly restored to Plutus his sight and had made Neoclides blinder than ever.		
A4377	The rich, whose wealth is ill-gotten, are knitting their brows and shooting at him looks of fierce hate, while the just folk, who led a wretched existence, embrace him and grasp his hand in the transport of their joy;		
A4378	Come, all of you, all, down to the very least, dance, leap and form yourselves into a chorus; no longer do you risk being told, when you go home. “There is no meal in the bag.”		
A4379	Alas! what manner of men I associated with! I blush to think of it. While, on the other hand, I shunned those who deserved my friendship; I knew neither the vices of the ones nor the virtues of the others. A two-fold mistake, and in both cases equally fatal!		
A4380	Oh! what a lot of friends spring into being when you are fortunate! They dig me with their elbows and bruise my shins to prove their affection. Each one wants to greet me. What a crowd of old fellows thronged round me on the market-place!		
A4381	How pleasant it is, friends, to live well, especially when it costs nothing!  What a deluge of blessings flood our household, and that too without our having wronged a single soul!  [Ah! what a delightful thing is wealth!		
A4382	My father had left me a fairly decent fortune, and I helped those of my friends who were in want; it was, to my thinking, the most useful thing I could do with my fortune.		
A4383	With my empty coffers, I had no more friends.		
A4384	Is the country served by vile intrigue? Informer It is served by watching that the established law is observed —by allowing no one to violate it. Just Man That's the duty of the tribunals; they are established to that end.		
A4385	When poor, he would devour anything; now he is rich, he no longer cares for lentils.		
A4386	Because you have committed the most dreadful crime. Since Plutus has recovered his sight, there is nothing for us other gods, neither incense, nor laurels, nor cakes, nor victims, nor anything in the world.		
A4387	Hermes Formerly, from earliest dawn, I was offered all sorts of good things in the wine-shops, —wine-cakes, honey, dried figs, in short, dishes worthy of Hermes. Now, I lie the livelong day on my back, with my legs in the air, famishing.		
A4388	Since Plutus has recovered his sight, I am perishing of starvation; I, the priest of Zeus the Deliverer, have nothing to eat! Chremylus And what is the cause of that, pray? Priest No one dreams of offering sacrifices. Chremylus Why not? Priest Because all men are rich.		
A4389	we are going to install Plutus presently in the place he formerly occupied behind the Temple of Athena; there he will watch over our treasures for ever.		
A4390	not evident to the blind, that nowadays to do nothing that is right is the best way to get on?		
A4391	Plutus Zeus inflicted it on me, because of his jealousy of mankind. When I was young, I threatened him that I would only go to the just, the wise, the men of ordered life; to prevent my distinguishing these, he struck me with blindness! so much does he envy the good!		
A4392	Most assuredly. Whatever is dazzling, beautiful or charming in the eyes of mankind, comes from you. Does not everything depend on wealth?		
A4393	My master is going to drag you all out of the stupid, sapless life you are leading and ensure you one full of all delights. Leader of the Chorus		
A4394	I will no longer conceal the truth from you. Friends, it's Plutus whom my master brings, Plutus, who will give you riches.		
A4395	Seek physicians at Athens? Nay! there's no art where there's no fee.		
A4396	I come to thank the god for all the blessings he has showered on me. My father had left me a fairly decent fortune, and I helped those of my friends who were in want; it was, to my thinking, the most useful thing I could do with my fortune.		
A4397	Agathon's Chorus I do honor to the divine Leto and to the lyre, the mother of songsof male and noble strains. The eyes of the goddess sparkle while listening to our enthusiastic chants. Honor to the powerful Phoebus! Hail! blessed son of Leto.		
A4398	My dress is in harmony with my thoughts. A poet must adopt the nature of his characters. Thus, if he is placing women on the stage, he must contract all their habits in his own person.		
A4399	If the heroes are men, everything in him will be manly. What we don't possess by nature, we must acquire by imitation.		
A4400	For this reason his pieces were also beautiful, for the works of a poet are copied from himself.		
A4401	The women purpose killing me to-day during the Thesmophoria, because I have dared to speak ill of them.		
A4402	one must not try to trick misfortune, but resign oneself to it with good grace.		
A4403	Remember, it's the heart, and not the tongue, that has sworn; for the oaths of the tongue concern me but little.		
A4404	Mnesilochus Remember, it's the heart, and not the tongue, that has sworn; for the oaths of the tongue concern me but little.		
A4405	Be off, Thratta, be off; slaves have no right to be present at this gathering.		
A4406	Silence! Silence! Pray to the Thesmophorae, Demeter and Cora; pray to Plutus, Calligenia, Curotrophus, the Earth, Hermes and the Graces, that all may happen for the best at this gathering, both for the greatest advantage of Athensand for our own personal happiness! May the award be given her who, by both deeds and words, has most deserved it from the Athenian people and from the women! Address these prayers to heaven and demand happiness for yourselves. Io Paean! Io Paean! Let us rejoice!		
A4407	Let us unite our voices to the sounds of the golden lyre,and may wisdom preside at the gathering of the noble matrons of Athens.		
A4408	if there be a man who is plotting against the womenfolk or who, to injure them, is proposing peace to Euripides and the Medes, or who aspires to usurping the tyranny, plots the return of a tyrant, or unmasks a supposititious child; or if there be a slave who, a confidential party to a wife's intrigues, reveals them secretly to her husband, or who, entrusted with a message, does not deliver the same faithfully; if there be a lover who fulfils naught of what he has promised a woman, whom he has abused on the strength of his lies; if there be an old woman who seduces the lover of a maiden by dint of her presents and treacherously receives him in her house; if there be a host or hostess who sells false measure, pray the gods that they will overwhelm them with their wrath,both them and their families, and that they may reserve all their favours for you.		
A4409	Let us ask the fulfillment of these wishes both for the city and for the people, and may the wisest of us cause her opinion to be accepted.		
A4410	“There will be a gathering of the people on the morning of the third day of the Thesmophoria, which is a day of rest for us; the principal business there shall be the punishment that it is meet to inflict upon Euripides for the insults with which he has loaded us.		
A4411	But I have long been pained to see us women insulted by this Euripides, this son of the green-stuff woman, who loads us with every kind of indignity.		
A4412	“A woman is the tyrant of the old man who marries her.”		
A4413	Why certainly, by Artemis, and we are angry with Euripides, who assuredly treats us no worse than we deserve!		
A4414	What! we ought not to punish you, who alone have dared to defend the man who has done so much harm, whom it pleases to put all the vile women that ever were upon the stage, who only shows us Melanippes and Phaedras? But of Penelope he has never said a word, because she was reputed chaste and good.		
A4415	but formerly it was we who had the care of the food, who fetched the flour from the storeroom, the oil and the wine; we can do it no more. Our husbands now carry little Spartan keys on their persons, made with three notches and full of malice and spite. Formerly it sufficed to purchasea ring marked with the same sign for three obols, to open the most securely sealed-up door; but now this pestilent Euripides has taught men to hang seals of worm-eaten wood about their necks.		
A4416	He will knowhow we punish the outrage, the crime, the sacrilege. The criminal will then acknowledge at last that gods exist;		
A4417	his fate will teach all men that the deities must be revered, that justice must be observed and that they must submit to the sacred laws. If not, then woe to them! Heaven itself will punish sacrilege; being aflame with fury and mad with frenzy, all their deeds will prove to mortals, both men and women, that the deity punishes injustice and impiety, and that she is not slow to strike.		
A4418	Let us address ourselves to the spectators to sing our praises, despite the fact that each one says much ill of women. If the men are to be believed, we are a plague to them; through us come all their troubles, quarrels, disputes, sedition, griefs and wars. But if we are truly such a pest, why marry us? Why forbid us to go out or show ourselves at the window? You want to keep this pest, and take a thousand cares to do it.		
A4419	It is thus clear that we are better than you, and the proof of this is easy. Let us find out which is the worse of the two sexes. We say, “It's you,” while you aver, “it's we.” Come, let us compare them in detail, each individual man with a woman.		
A4420	Therefore we maintain that men are greatly our inferiors. You see no woman who has robbed the state of fifty talents rushing about the city in a magnificent chariot; our greatest peculations are a measure of corn, which we steal from our husbands, and even then we return it to them the very same day.		
A4421	We know how to keep our property better than you. We still have our cylinders, our beams, our baskets and our sunshades; whereas many among you have lost the wood of your spears as well as the iron, and many others have cast away their bucklers on the battlefield.		
A4422	There are many reproaches we have the right to bring against men. The most serious is this, that the woman, who has given birth to a useful citizen, whether taxiarch or strategus should receive some distinction; a place of honor should be reserved for her at the Stenia, the Scirophoria,and the other festivals that we keep.		
A4423	On the other hand, she of whom a coward was born or a worthless man, a bad trierarch or an unskilful pilot, should sit with shaven head, behind her sister who had borne a brave man.		
A4424	It's wrong to suppose that, because I am a woman and in this temple, I am going to speak ill of men;		
A4425	Women, if you will be reconciled with me, I am willing, and I undertake never to say anything ill of you in future. Those are my proposals for peace.		
A4426	This unfortunate man, who is chained to the post, is my father-in-law; if you will restore him to me, you will have no more cause to complain of me; but if not, I shall reveal your pranks to your husbands when they return from the war.		
A4427	What need for you to hear what you are going to see?		
A4428	is going to construct the framework of a drama. He is rounding fresh poetical forms, he is polishing them in the lathe and is welding them; he is hammering out sentences and metaphors; he is working up his subject like soft wax. First he models it and then he casts it in bronze—		
A4429	the women have plotted my ruin, and to-day they are to gather in the Temple of Demeter to execute their decision. Mnesilochus What have they against you? Euripides Because I mishandle them in my tragedies.		
A4430	You look for all the world like a woman. But when you talk, take good care to give your voice a woman's tone.		
A4431	But woe to those women who break their oaths, who speculate on the public misfortune, who seek to alter the laws and the decrees, who reveal our secrets to the foe and admit the Medes into our territory so that they may devastate it!		
A4432	Let us form fresh measures that keep good time, and may our songs resound to the very heavens.  Do thou, oh divine Bacchus, who art crowned with ivy, direct our chorus; 'tis to thee that both my hymns and my dances are dedicated.		
A4433	Ah! what can be done? what arguments can I use? This savage will understand nothing! The newest and most cunning fancies are a dead letter to the ignorant.		
A4434	And ye, august goddesses, display a smiling and propitious countenance to our gaze; come into your sacred grove, the entry to which is forbidden to men; 'tis there in the midst of the sacred orgies that we contemplate your divine features.		
A4435	Old man, old man, I hear the shafts of jealousy whistling by my ears, but they do not hit me. My dress is in harmony with my thoughts. A poet must adopt the nature of his characters. Thus, if he is placing women on the stage, he must contract all their habits in his own person.		
A4436	Agathon If the heroes are men, everything in him will be manly. What we don't possess by nature, we must acquire by imitation.		
A4437	There are many reproaches we have the right to bring against men. The most serious is this, that the woman, who has given birth to a useful citizen, whether taxiarch or strategus should receive some distinction; a place of honor should be reserved for her at the Stenia, the Scirophoria,and the other festivals that we keep. On the other hand, she of whom a coward was born or a worthless man, a bad trierarch or an unskilful pilot, should sit with shaven head, behind her sister who had borne a brave man. O		
A4438	O mother, from a palace to face a life of slavery, how sad your lot, as sad as once it was blessed! Some god is now destroying you, setting this in the balance to outweigh your former bliss.		
A4439	for slavery too cruel to endure, to bear!		
A4440	No more shall I your daughter share your bondage		
A4441	For your unhappiness I weep with plaintive wail, mother		
A4442	Even in adversity it is wise to yield to reason's dictates		
A4443	But if the bond may ask the free  of things that do not grieve them or wrench their heart-strings, you ought to speak in answer to my questions and I ought to hear what you have to say.		
A4444	Did you embrace my knees in all humility?		
A4445	Are not you then playing a sorry part to plot against me thus, after the kind treatment you by your own confession received from me, showing me no gratitude but all the ill you can? A thankless race! all you who covet honor from the mob  for your oratory. Oh that you were unknown to me! you who harm your friends and think no more of it, if you can say a word to win the mob. But tell me, what kind of cleverness did they think it, when against this child they passed their bloody vote?  Was it duty that led them to slay a human victim at the tomb, where sacrifice of oxen is more fitting? or does Achilles, if claiming the lives of those who slew him as his recompense, show his justice by marking her out for death? No! she at least never injured him.  He should have demanded Helen as a victim at his tomb, for she it was that proved his ruin, bringing him to Troy; or if some captive of surpassing beauty was to be singled out for death, this did not point to us; for the daughter of Tyndareus was fairest of all,  and her injury to him was proved no less than ours. Against the justice of his plea I pit this argument.		
A4446	It is not right that those in power should use it out of season, or, when prosperous, suppose they will be always so.		
A4447	For among you the same law holds good for slave and free alike respecting bloodshed		
A4448	for the same argument, when proceeding from those of no account,  has not the same force as when it is uttered by men of mark		
A4449	Human nature is not so stony-hearted as to hear your plaintive tale and catalogue of sorrows, without shedding a tear.		
A4450	Alas! how cursed is slavery always in its nature, forced by the might of the stronger to endure unseemly treatment.		
A4451	Take heart; you are safe from the suppliant's god in my case, for I will follow you, both because I must and because it is my wish to die; for if I were unwilling, a coward would I show myself, a woman faint of heart.		
A4452	but now I am a slave! That name first makes me long for death, so strange it sounds;		
A4453	No, never! Here I close my eyes upon the light, free as yet, and dedicate myself to Hades. Lead me away, Odysseus, and do your worst,  for I see nothing within my reach to make me hope or expect with any confidence that I am ever again to be happy. Mother, do not seek to hinder me by word or deed, but join in my wish for death before I meet with shameful treatment undeserved.  For whoever is not used to taste of sorrows, though he bears it, yet it galls him when he puts his neck within the yoke; far happier would he be dead than alive, for life bereft of honor is toil and trouble.		
A4454	A noble speech, my daughter!		
A4455	Odysseus, if you must please the son of Peleus, and avoid reproach,  do not slay this maid, but lead me to Achilles' pyre and torture me unsparingly; it was I that bore Paris, whose fatal shaft laid low the son of Thetis.		
A4456	Mother, listen to me; and you, son of Laertes, make allowance for a parent's natural wrath. My poor mother, do not fight with our masters.  Will you be thrown to the ground, be roughly thrust aside and wound your aged skin, and in unseemly fashion be torn from me by youthful arms? This you will suffer; but do not, for it is not right for you. No, my dear mother! give me your beloved hand,  and let me press your cheek to mine; for never again, but now for the last time, shall I behold the dazzling sun-god's orb. Take my last farewells now. O mother, my mother! I pass beneath the earth.		
A4457	O my daughter, I am still to live and be a slave.		
A4458	Where will you bear me, the sorrowful one? To whose house shall I be brought, to be his slave and chattel?  to some haven in the Dorian land, or in Phthia, where men say Apidanus, father of fairest streams, makes fat and rich the soil?		
A4459	Alas for my children! alas for my ancestors, and my country which is falling in smouldering ruin among the smoke, sacked by the Argive spear, while I upon a foreign  shore am called a slave, indeed!  leaving Asia, Europe's handmaid, and receiving in its place a deadly marriage-bower.		
A4460	Daughter of a free-born father, a slave I am to die.		
A4461	Ah! old as I am, may death be my lot before I am caught in any shameful mischance. Arise, poor lady! lift up  yourself and raise that white head.		
A4462	“O Argives, who have sacked my city! of my free will I die; let no one lay hand on me; for bravely will I yield my neck.  By the gods, leave me free; so slay me, that death may find me free; for to be called a slave among the dead fills my royal heart with shame.”		
A4463	yet the story of your noble death has taken from the keenness of my grief		
A4464	He is happiest who meets no sorrow day by day.		
A4465	O dreadful crime! O deed without a name! beyond wonder!  impious! intolerable! Where are the laws between guest and host? Accursed of men! how have you mangled his flesh, slashing the poor child's limbs  with ruthless sword, lost to all sense of pity!		
A4466	But if he should count me as a slave and foe and spurn me from his knees, I would add to my anguish.		
A4467	but, if otherwise, help me to punish  this most godless host, fearless alike of gods in heaven or hell, who has done a most unholy deed; who, though often he had shared my board and been counted first of all my guest-friends  meeting with every kindness he could claim—. And receiving my consideration, he slew my son, and bent though he was on murder, did not think it right to bury him, but cast his body forth to sea.		
A4468	Custom too which prevails over them,  for by custom it is that we believe in them and set up boundaries of right and wrong for our lives.		
A4469	Now if this principle, when referred to you, is to be set at nothing, and they are to escape punishment who murder guests or dare to plunder the temples of gods,  then all fairness in human matters is at an end.		
A4470	Why, oh! why do we mortals toil, as we must, and seek out all other sciences,  but Persuasion, the only real mistress of mankind, we take no further pains to master completely by offering to pay for the knowledge, so that any man could convince his fellows as he pleased and gain his point at once?		
A4471	For it is always a good man's duty to help the right,  and to punish evil-doers wherever found.		
A4472	Ah! there is not in the world a single man free;  for he is a slave either to money or to fortune, or else the people in their thousands or the fear of public prosecution prevents him from following the dictates of his heart.		
A4473	Agamemnon How are women to master men? Hecuba Numbers are a fearful thing, and joined to craft a desperate foe. Agamemnon  True; still I have a mean opinion of the female race.		
A4474	this is the interest alike of citizen and state, that the wrong-doer be punished and the good man prosper		
A4475	For the gods confound our fortunes, tossing them to and fro, and introduce confusion, so that our perplexity  may make us worship them.		
A4476	For the rights of justice and of the gods do not fall together;  there is ruin full of death and doom.		
A4477	Woe to you! what grievous outrage has been done to you! a fearful penalty for your foul deed.		
A4478	banish that savage spirit from your heart  and plead your cause, so that after hearing you and her in turn I may fairly decide what reason there is for your present sufferings.		
A4479	But to spare you a lengthy speech, if any of the men of former times have spoken ill of women, if any does so now, or shall do so hereafter,  I will say all this in one short sentence; for neither land or sea produces such a race, as whoever has had to do with them knows.		
A4480	Never ought words to have outweighed deeds in this world, Agamemnon. No! if a man's deeds were good, so should his words have been;  if, on the other hand, evil, his words should have been unsound, instead of its being possible at times to speak injustice well. There are, it is true, clever persons, who have made a science of this, but their cleverness cannot last for ever; a miserable end awaits them; no one ever yet escaped.		
A4481	Ah! how a good cause always affords men an opening for a good speech.		
A4482	Away to the harbour and the tents, my friends, to prove the toils of  slavery! for such is fate's relentless hest.		
A4483	O Hecuba, be schooled by me, and do not in your angry mood  count him a foe who speaks wisely. Your life I am prepared to save, for the service I received; I do not say otherwise. But what I said to all, I will not now deny, that after Troy's capture I would give your daughter to the chief man of our army  because he asked a victim. For here is a source of weakness to many states, whenever a man of brave and generous soul receives no greater honor than his inferiors. Now Achilles, lady, deserves honor at our hands,  since on behalf of Hellas the man died most nobly. Is not this a foul reproach to treat him as a friend in life, but, when he is gone from us, to treat him so no more? Enough! what will they say, if once more there comes a gathering of the army and a contest with the foe?  “Shall we fight or nurse our lives, seeing the dead have no honors?” For myself, indeed, when alive, if my daily store were scant, yet it would be all-sufficient, but my tomb I should wish  to be an object of respect, for this gratitude has long to run. You speak of cruel sufferings; hear my answer. Among us are grey old women and men no less miserable than you, and brides bereft of gallant husbands,  over whom this Trojan dust has closed. Endure these sorrows; for us, if we are wrong in resolving to honor the brave, we shall bring upon ourselves a charge of ignorance; but as for you barbarians, do not regard your friends as such and pay no homage to your gallant dead,  so that Hellas may prosper and you may reap the fruits of such policy.		
A4484	This it is that most rescues life from trouble,  when a woman is not at variance with her husband.		
A4485	But now all is enmity, and love's bonds are diseased.		
A4486	Poor Medea, finding herself thus cast aside, calls loudly on his oaths, invokes the mighty assurance of his sworn right hand, and calls the gods to witness the unjust return she is getting from Jason.		
A4487	For she has a terrible temper and will not put up with bad treatment		
A4488	to trusty servants it is a disaster when the dice of their masters' fortunes  fall badly: it touches their hearts. So great is the grief I feel that the desire stole over me to come out here and speak my mistress' troubles to the earth and the sky.		
A4489	Yet he is certainly guilty of disloyalty towards his loved ones.		
A4490	Are you just now learning this, that each man loves himself more than his neighbor, [some justly, others for the sake of gain,]		
A4491	The minds of royalty are dangerous:  since they often command and seldom obey, they are subject to violent changes of mood.		
A4492	For it is better to be accustomed to live on terms of equality. At any rate, may I be able to grow old in modest state and with security.		
A4493	it is no joy I feel at this house's misfortunes since I have shared the cup of friendship with it.		
A4494	Zeus will be your advocate in this.		
A4495	May I one day see him and his new bride ground to destruction, and their whole house with them,  so terrible are the wrongs they are bold to do me unprovoked!		
A4496	You would be right to call men of old foolish, not at all wise: for while they invented songs for festivities, banquets, and dinners and added pleasant sounds to human life,  no one discovered how to put an end to mortals' bitter griefs with music and song sung to the lyre. It is because of these griefs that deaths and terrible disasters overthrow houses. It would have been a gain for mortals  to cure these ills by song.		
A4497	There is no justice in mortals' eyes  since before they get sure knowledge of a man's true character they hate him on sight, although he has done them no harm.		
A4498	Now a foreigner must be quite compliant with the city, nor do I have any words of praise for the citizen who is stubborn and causes his fellow-citizens pain by his lack of breeding.		
A4499	Of all creatures that have breath and sensation, we women are the most unfortunate. First at an exorbitant price we must buy a husband and master of our bodies. [This misfortune is more painful than misfortune.]  And the outcome of our life's striving hangs on this, whether we take a bad or a good husband. For divorce is discreditable for women and it is not possible to refuse wedlock. And when a woman comes into the new customs and practices of her husband's house, she must somehow divine, since she has not learned it at home,  how she shall best deal with her husband. If after we have spent great efforts on these tasks our husbands live with us without resenting the marriage-yoke, our life is enviable. Otherwise, death is preferable. A man, whenever he is annoyed with the company of those in the house,  goes elsewhere and thus rids his soul of its boredom [turning to some male friend or age-mate]. But we must fix our gaze on one person only. Men say that we live a life free from danger at home while they fight with the spear.  How wrong they are! I would rather stand three times with a shield in battle than give birth once.		
A4500	In all other things a woman is full of fear, incapable of looking on battle or cold steel;  but when she is injured in love, no mind is more murderous than hers.		
A4501	if I find any means or contrivance to punish my husband for these wrongs [and the bride's father and the bride], keep my secret.		
A4502	you are a clever woman and skilled in many evil arts, and you are smarting with the loss of your husband's love.		
A4503	No man who is sensible ought ever  to have his children educated beyond the common run. For apart from the charge of idleness they incur, they earn hostility and ill-will from their fellow-citizens. If you bring novel wisdom to fools, you will be regarded as useless, not wise;  and if the city regards you as greater than those with a reputation for cleverness, you will be thought vexatious.		
A4504	A hot-tempered woman—and a hot-tempered man likewise—  is easier to guard against than a clever woman who keeps her own counsel.		
A4505	But will you banish me without the regard due a suppliant?5		
A4506	Allow me to remain this one day and to complete my plans for exile and to ensure some provision for my children, since their father does not care to do so. Have pity on them: you too are a parent,  and we might expect you to be well-disposed towards them. I do not care if I myself go into exile. It is their experience of misfortune I weep for.		
A4507	[Unhappy woman,] O dear, crushed by your misfortunes, where will you turn? What protector of strangers will you find,  what house, what land, to save you from calamity?  Medea, a god has cast you into a hopeless sea of troubles.		
A4508	And furthermore we are women, unable to perform great deeds of valor, but most skilful architects of every evil.		
A4509	Backward to their sources flow the streams of holy rivers, and the order of all things is reversed: men's thoughts have become deceitful and their oaths by the gods do not hold fast.  The common talk will so alter that women's ways will enjoy good repute. Honor is coming to the female sex: no more will women be maligned  by slanderous rumor.		
A4510	The poetry of ancient bards will cease to hymn our faithlessness. Phoebus lord of song never endowed our minds  with the glorious strains of the lyre. Else I could have sounded a hymn in reply to the male sex. The long expanse of time can say many things of men's lot  as well as of women's.		
A4511	You have no father's home in which to find anchorage, unhappy woman, and another, a princess, greater match than yourself,  holds sway in the house.		
A4512	exile brings many hardships with it.		
A4513	This is not boldness or courage—  to wrong your loved ones and then look them in the face—but the worst of all mortal vices, shamelessness.		
A4514	And after such benefits from me, o basest of men, you have betrayed me and have taken a new marriage,  though we had children. For if you were still childless, your desire for this marriage would be understandable.		
A4515	But come now—for I will share my thoughts with you as a friend  （yet what benefit can I expect to get from you? Still I will do it, for you will be shown up in an uglier light by my questions）		
A4516	It appears, woman, that I must be no mean speaker but like the good helmsman of a ship reef my sail up to its hem and run before the storm  of your wearisome prattling.		
A4517	First, you now live among Greeks and not barbarians, and you understand justice and the rule of law, with no concession to force.		
A4518	But you women are so far gone in folly that if all is well  in bed you think you have everything, while if some misfortune in that domain occurs, you regard as hateful your best and truest interests. Mortals ought, you know, to beget children from some other source, and there should be no female sex.  Then mankind would have no trouble.		
A4519	I realize I have far different views from the majority of mortals.  To my mind, the plausible speaker who is a scoundrel incurs the greatest punishment. For since he is confident that he can cleverly cloak injustice with his words, his boldness stops at no knavery. Yet he is not as wise as all that.		
A4520	May that man die unloved who cannot  honor his friends, unlocking to them his honest mind. To me at any rate he shall never be friend.		
A4521	He has put another woman over me as mistress of the house. Aegeus  Surely he has not dared such a shameful act?		
A4522	If you come to my country, I shall in justice try to act as your protector.		
A4523	O Zeus and Zeus's justice, o light of the sun,  now, my friends, I shall be victorious over my enemies: I have set my foot on the path. Now I may confidently expect that my enemies will pay the penalty. For this man, at the very point where I was most in trouble, has appeared as a harbor for my plans:  to him will I tie my cable when I go to the city of Pallas Athena.		
A4524	What do I gain by living? I have no fatherland, no house and no means to turn aside misfortune.		
A4525	This man—a god being my helper—will pay the price of his deeds to me. He shall never from this day see his children by me alive, nor will he beget children  by his new bride since that wretch must die a wretched death by my poisons.		
A4526	No, quite the opposite, hurtful to foes, to friends kindly.  Such persons live a life of greatest glory.		
A4527	Tell him nothing of my intentions, if you are loyal to your mistress and a woman.		
A4528	I have talked with myself and reproached myself thus: ‘Foolish creature, why am I raving and fighting those who plan things for the best?  Why am I making myself an enemy to the rulers of this land and to my husband, who is acting in my interests by marrying a princess and begetting brothers for my children? Shall I not cease from my wrath （what has come over me?） when the gods are being so kind?  Do I not have the children? Is it not true that we are exiles and in need of friends?’ These reflections have made me realize that I was being very foolish and was being angry for nothing. So now I approve and I agree that you are acting with sober sense  by contracting this marriage-alliance for us. It is I who am the fool, since I ought to be sharing in your plans, helping you carry them out, standing by the marriage-bed, and taking joy in the match I was making with your bride. But we women are, I will not say bad creatures,  but we are what we are.		
A4529	For it is natural for a woman to get angry  when a marriage of a different sort presents itself to the husband. But your thoughts have changed for the better, and though it took time, you have recognized the superior plan. These are the acts of a prudent woman.		
A4530	But a woman is by nature female and prone to tears.		
A4531	Not a word! They say gifts win over even the gods,  and gold is more to mortals than ten thousand words. Her star is on the rise [heaven is enhancing her lot, she is young and on the throne]. And to free my children from exile I would give my life, not merely gold.		
A4532	And you, unlucky bridegroom, married into the house of kings, all unwitting you bring destruction upon your children's life and upon your wife a dreadful death.  Unhappy man, how wrong you were about your destiny.		
A4533	Oh! What is the meaning of your glance at me, children? Why do you smile at me this last smile of yours? Alas, what am I to do? My courage is gone, women, ever since I saw the bright faces of the children. I cannot do it. Farewell, my former  designs! I shall take my children out of the land. Why should I wound their father with their pain and win for myself pain twice as great? I shall not: farewell, my designs! But what is coming over me? Do I wish to suffer mockery,  letting my enemies go unpunished? Must I put up with that? No, it is mere weakness in me even to admit such tender words into my heart. Children, go into the house. Whoever is not permitted to attend my sacrifice  shall feel concern for them: I shall not weaken my hand. [Oh! Do not, my angry heart, do not do these things. Let them go, hard-hearted wretch, spare the children. If they live with me in that other place,16 they will gladden you. By Hell's avenging furies,  I shall never leave my children for my enemies to outrage.17 They must die in any case. And since they must, the one who gave them birth shall kill them. These things are settled in any case and cannot be undone.]		
A4534	I can no longer look at you but am overwhelmed with my pain. And I know well what pain I am about to undergo, but my wrath overbears my calculation,  wrath that brings mortal men their gravest hurt.		
A4535	Often ere now I have engaged in discourses subtler, and entered upon contests greater, than is right for woman to peer into.  No, we too possess a muse, who consorts with us to bring us wisdom: not with all of us, for it is some small clan, one woman among many, that you will find with a share in the Muse.		
A4536	As for our mortal life, this is not the first time that I have thought it to be a shadow,  and I would say without any fear that those mortals who seem to be clever and workers-up of polished speeches are guilty of the greatest folly. For no mortal ever attains to blessedness. One may may be luckier than another  when wealth flows his way, but blessed never.		
A4537	O womankind and marriage fraught with pain, how many are the troubles you have already wrought for mortal men!		
A4538	O detestable creature, utterly hateful to the gods, to me, and to the whole human race,  you brought yourself to take the sword to your own children and destroyed my life with childlessness! And having done this can you look on the sun and the earth, when you are guilty of a most abominable deed? Death and ruin seize you! Now I am in my right mind, though I was insane before  when I brought you from your home among the barbarians to a Greek house. A great curse you were even then, betrayer of father and of the land that nourished you. But the avenging spirit meant for you the gods have visited on me. For you killed your own brother at the hearth  and then stepped aboard the fair-prowed Argo. It was with acts like these that you began. But now when you were married to me and had borne me children, you killed them because of sex and the marriage-bed. No Greek woman  would have dared to do this, yet I married you in preference to them, and a hateful and destructive match it has proved. You are a she-lion, not a woman, with a nature more savage than Scylla the Tuscan monster. But since ten thousand insults of mine would fail  to sting you—such is your native impudence—be gone, doer of disgraceful deeds and murderer of your children! Mine is a fate to bewail: I shall never have the benefit of my new bride, nor will I be able to speak to my children alive,  the children I begot and raised, but have lost them.		
A4539	Long would have been the speech I had made in reply to these words of yours if Father Zeus did not know clearly what kind of treatment you have had from me and how you have repaid it. You were not going to cast aside my bed  and then spend a pleasant life laughing at me, no, nor the princess either, nor was Creon, who offered you his daughter, going to exile me with impunity. Call me a she-lion, then, if you like and Scylla, dweller on the Tuscan cliff.  For I have touched your heart in the vital spot.		
A4540	For a woman of sense, yes. But you find everything a disaster.		
A4541	They live, alas, as spirits to take vengeance on your crimes.		
A4542	May the Fury that punishes your children's death, and  Justice the murderous,23 destroy you utterly!		
A4543	Zeus on Olympus has many things in his treasure-house, and many are the things the gods accomplish against our expectation. What men expect is not brought to pass, but a god finds a way to achieve the unexpected.		
A4544	For moderate fortune has a name that is fairest on the tongue, and in practice it is by far the most beneficial thing for mortals. But excessive riches mean no advantage for mortals, and when a god is angry at a house,  they make the ruin greater.		
A4545	May Aphrodite never cast contentious wrath and insatiate quarreling upon me and  madden my heart with love for a stranger's bed. But may she honor marriages that are peaceful and wisely determine whom we are to wed.		
A4546	My herald has gone to the city, to call Theseus here, so that he may rid the land of that which grieves them, or loose these suppliant bonds,  with pious observance of the gods' will;		
A4547	for women should in all cases invoke the aid of men, women that are discreet.		
A4548	This prayer I make, when I behold these aged women, who, leaving their homes in Argos,  now throw themselves with suppliant branches at my knees in their terrible trouble		
A4549	My herald has gone to the city, to call Theseus here, so that he may rid the land of that which grieves them, or loose these suppliant bonds,  with pious observance of the gods' will; for women should in all cases invoke the aid of men, women that are discreet. Chorus		
A4550	Not as piety enjoins, but from necessity I have come to the fire-crowned altars of the gods, falling on my knees with my demand,  for my cause is just, and it is in your power, blessed as you are in your children, to remove from me my woe;		
A4551	My son, these are the mothers of those seven generals, who fell around the gates of Cadmus' town. With suppliant boughs they keep me prisoner, as you see, in their midst.		
A4552	for nothing can be achieved save through the utterance of your tongue.		
A4553	There I lost the pick of Argos' sons. Theseus These are the results of that unhappy war.		
A4554	Success makes them forget how to bear their fortune.		
A4555	Is this your own private resolve, or the wish of all the city? Adrastus  The sons of Danaus, one and all, implore you to bury the dead.		
A4556	What did Apollo say to determine the maidens' marriage? Adrastus  That I should give my two daughters to a wild boar and a lion.		
A4557	Did you give your daughters to them as to wild beasts? Adrastus Yes, for, as they fought, I likened them to those two monsters.		
A4558	What! did brother rob brother of his.inheritance?		
A4559	Theseus  Did you consult seers, and gaze into the flame of burnt-offerings? Adrastus Ah me! you press on the very point where I failed most. Theseus It seems your going was not favored by heaven.		
A4560	Adrastus  I was carried away by the clamor of younger men. Theseus You favored courage instead of discretion.		
A4561	And it is wise in the rich to see the poor man's poverty, and in the poor man to turn ambitious eyes toward the rich, that so he may himself indulge a longing for possessions; and they, whom fortune does not frown on, should dread misery. . . .		
A4562	This I am bound to declare. Sparta is cruel, her customs variable; the other states are small and weak. Your city alone would be able to undertake this labor;  for it turns an eye on misery, and has in you a young and gallant shepherd;		
A4563	For there are those who say, there is more bad than good in human nature; but I hold a contrary view, that good over bad predominates in man,  for if it were not so, we should not exist.		
A4564	He has my praise, whichever god brought us to live by rule from chaos and from brutishness, first by implanting reason, and next by giving us a tongue to declare our thoughts, so as to know the meaning of what is said,		
A4565	For there are those who say, there is more bad than good in human nature; but I hold a contrary view, that good over bad predominates in man,  for if it were not so, we should not exist. He has my praise, whichever god brought us to live by rule from chaos and from brutishness, first by implanting reason, and next by giving us a tongue to declare our thoughts, so as to know the meaning of what is said,  and bestowing fruitful crops, and drops of rain from heaven to make them grow, with which to nourish earth's fruits and to water her lap; and more than this, protection from the wintry storm, and means to ward from us the sun-god's scorching heat; the art of sailing over the sea, so that we might exchange  with one another whatever our countries lack.		
A4566	Are we not then too proud, when heaven has made such  preparation for our life, not to be content with it? But our presumption seeks to lord it over heaven, and in the pride of our hearts we think we are wiser than the gods.		
A4567	no! never should the wise man have joined the stock of just and unjust in one,  but should have gotten prosperous friends for his family.		
A4568	For the god, confusing their destinies, often destroys by the sufferer's fate his fellow sufferer, who never committed injustice.		
A4569	You led all Argos forth to battle,  though seers proclaimed the will of heaven, and then in scorn of them and in violent disregard of the gods have ruined your city, led away by younger men, those who court distinction, and add war to war unrighteously, destroying their fellow-citizens;		
A4570	For there are three ranks of citizens; the rich, a useless set, that ever crave for more;  the poor and destitute, fearful folk, that cherish envy more than is right, and shoot out grievous stings against the men who have anything, beguiled as they are by the eloquence of vicious leaders; while the class that is midmost of the three preserves cities,  observing such order as the state ordains.		
A4571	I did not choose you to judge my affliction; no! nor if in anything my fortunes prove me wrong,  did I come to you to punish or correct them, but to seek your help.		
A4572	Will you betray these suppliant symbols, and banish from your land these aged women without the boon they should obtain? Do not so; even the wild beast fInds a refuge in the rock, the slave in the altars of the gods, and a state when tempest-tossed cowers to its neighbor's shelter;		
A4573	for in this life of man  there is nothing that is blessed unto its end.		
A4574	By your beard, kind friend, glory of Hellas, I do beseech you, as I clasp your knees and hands in my misery.  O pity me as I entreat for my sons with my tale of wretched woe, like some beggar. Do not, child, let my sons lie there unburied in the land of Cadmus, glad prey for beasts, while you are in your prime, I implore you. See the tear-drop tremble in my eye,  as thus I throw myself at your knees to win my children burial.		
A4575	Yes, for often even from women come wise counsels.		
A4576	Aethra May I say something, my son, a glory to you and to the city? Theseus Yes, for often even from women come wise counsels.		
A4577	Shame! to hide from friends good counsel.		
A4578	No then, I will not hold my peace to blame myself afterwards for having now kept silence to my shame, nor will I forego my honorable proposal, from the common fear  that it is useless for women to give good advice		
A4579	for this it is that holds men's states together—strict observance of the laws.		
A4580	And some, no doubt, will say it was cowardice made you stand aloof in terror,  when you might have won for your city a crown of glory, and, though you encountered a savage swine, laboring for a sorry task, yet when the time came for you to face the helmet and pointed spear, and do your best, you were found to be coward.		
A4581	But states whose policy is dark and cautious  have their sight darkened by their carefulness.		
A4582	For by a long and glorious career  I have displayed this habit among Hellenes, of ever punishing the wicked.		
A4583	Yes, I will go about this business and rescue the dead by persuasive words; or, failing that, the spear at once shall decide this issue, nor will the gods grudge me this.		
A4584	But I require the whole city's sanction also,  which my wish will ensure; still, by communicating the proposal to them I would find the people better disposed. For I made them supreme, when I set this city free, by giving all an equal vote.		
A4585	Yes, I will go about this business and rescue the dead by persuasive words; or, failing that, the spear at once shall decide this issue, nor will the gods grudge me this. But I require the whole city's sanction also,  which my wish will ensure; still, by communicating the proposal to them I would find the people better disposed. For I made them supreme, when I set this city free, by giving all an equal vote.		
A4586	for a wretched son is he who does not serve his parents in return—fairest contribution; for, when he made his gift, he in his turn from his own sons receives all such service as he gave to his parents.		
A4587	For pious toil is a fair ornament to cities, and carries with it a grace that never wastes away.		
A4588	O help the mother, city of Pallas, that so they may not pollute the laws of all mankind. You, I know,  reverence right, and to injustice deal out  defeat, a protection at all times to the afflicted.		
A4589	You have made a false beginning to your speech, stranger, in seeking a despot here. For this city is not ruled  by one man, but is free.		
A4590	The people rule in succession year by year, allowing no preference to wealth, but the poor man shares equally with the rich.		
A4591	for the city from which I come is ruled by one man only, not by the mob; no one there puffs up the citizens with specious words, and for his own advantage twists them this way or that, one moment dear to them and lavish of his favors,  the next harmful to all; and yet by fresh calumnies of others he hides his former failures and escapes punishment.		
A4592	Besides, how would the people, if it cannot form true judgments, be able rightly to direct the state? No, it is time, not haste, that affords a better  understanding. A poor farmer, even if he were not unschooled, would still be unable from his toil to give his mind to politics. Truly the better sort count it no healthy sign when the worthless man obtains a reputation  by beguiling with words the populace, though before he was nothing.		
A4593	Nothing is more hostile to a city than a despot;		
A4594	Nothing is more hostile to a city than a despot;  where he is, there are first no laws common to all, but one man is tyrant, in whose keeping and in his alone the law resides, and in that case equality is at an end.		
A4595	But when the laws are written down, rich and weak alike have equal justice,  and it is open to the weaker to use the same language to the prosperous when he is reviled by him, and the weaker prevails over the stronger if he has justice on his side.		
A4596	Freedom's mark is also seen in this: “Who has wholesome counsel to declare unto the state?”  And he who chooses to do so gains renown, while he, who has no wish, remains silent. What greater equality can there be in a city?		
A4597	Again, where the people are absolute rulers of the land, they rejoice in having a reserve of youthful citizens, while a king counts this a hostile element,  and strives to slay the leading men, all such as he thinks discreet, fearing for his power.		
A4598	How then could a city remain stable, where one cuts short all enterprise and mows down the young like meadow-flowers in spring-time?  What good is it to acquire wealth and livelihood for children, merely to add to the tyrant's substance by one's toil? Why train up daughters virtuously in our homes to gratify a tyrant's whim, whenever he wishes, and cause tears to those who rear them?		
A4599	For whenever the city has to vote on the question of war, no man ever takes his own death into account, but shifts this misfortune on to another; but if death were before their eyes when they were giving their votes, Hellas would never rush to her doom in mad desire for battle.		
A4600	And yet each man among us knows which of the two to prefer, the good or ill, and how much better peace is for mankind than war, peace, the Muses' dearest friend,  the foe of Sorrow, whose joy is in glad throngs of children, and its delight in prosperity. These are the blessings we cast away and wickedly embark on war, man enslaving his weaker brother, and cities following suit.		
A4601	The wise should love their children first, next their parents and country, whose fortunes they ought to increase rather than break down		
A4602	Rashness in a leader causes failure; the sailor of a ship is calm, wise at the proper time.		
A4603	Let the dead now be buried in the earth, and each element return to the place from where it came to the body, the breath to the air, the body to the ground; for in no way did we get it  for our own, but to live our life in, and after that its mother earth must take it back again.		
A4604	Go, triflers, learn the lesson of human misery;  our life is made up of struggles; there are some men that find their fortune soon, others have to wait, while some at once are blessed. Fortune lives a dainty life; to her the wretched pays his court and homage to win her smile; her likewise the prosperous man extols, for fear the favoring gale  may leave him. These lessons we should take to heart, to bear with moderation, free from wrath, our wrongs, and do nothing to hurt a whole city.		
A4605	Vengeance calls vengeance forth; slaughter calls for slaughter,  but the gods give to mortals respite from affliction, holding in their own hands each thing's allotted end.		
A4606	Such is the general men should choose, one who shows his bravery in danger, yet hates the pride of those that in their hour of fortune lose the bliss they might have enjoyed,  through seeking to scale the ladder's topmost step.		
A4607	O you who strain your bow  beyond the mark; you foolish sons of men, only by suffering many evils as you deserve, though deaf to friends, yet you yield to circumstances; you cities likewise, though you might by parley end your ills, yet you choose the sword instead of reason to settle disputes.		
A4608	Joy is here and sorrow too. For the state fair fame,  and for our captains a double prize.		
A4609	What need did I have of children?  I think I should not have suffered overmuch, if I had never borne the marriage-yoke;		
A4610	for noble nurture carries reverence with it, and every man, when once he has practised virtue, scorns the name of villain.		
A4611	Courage may be learned, for even a baby learns  to speak and hear things it cannot comprehend; and whatever someone has learned, this it is his wont to treasure up till he is old. So train up your children in a virtuous way.

Courage may be learned, for even a baby learns  to speak and hear things it cannot comprehend; and whatever someone has learned, this it is his wont to treasure up till he is old. So train up your children in a virtuous way.		
A4613	O wretched sons of men!  Why do you get weapons and bring slaughter on one another? Cease from that, give over your toiling, and in mutual peace keep safe your cities.		
A4614	Short is the span of life, so it would be best to run its course as lightly as we may, free from trouble.		
A4615	Away with life and marriage too! Oh! may my children live to see the dawn of a fairer, happier wedding-day in Argos! A pious wedded husband fused with the guileless airs  of a noble wife!		
A4616	Ah me! why do mortal men not have this, to live their youth twice over, and twice in turn to reach old age? If anything goes wrong within our homes, we set it right by judgment more maturely formed, but our life we may not so correct. Now if we had a second spell  of youth and age, this double term of life would let us then correct each previous slip.		
A4617	Whereas if I had had my present experience,  and by a father's light had learned how cruel a thing it is to be bereft of children, never should I have fallen on such evil days as these		
A4618	when you are young men, the town beside Ismenus shall you sack,  avenging the slaughter of your dead fathers;		
A4619	For to their sorrow shall you come like lion's whelps in full-grown might to sack their city. No otherwise is it to be;  and you shall be a theme for minstrels' songs in days to come, known through Hellas as “the After-born”; so famous shall your expedition be, thanks to the god.		
A4620	Ismene, my sister, true child of my own mother, do you know any evil out of all the evils bequeathed by Oedipus that Zeus will not fulfil for the two of us in our lifetime?		
A4621	There is nothing—no pain, no ruin,no shame, nor dishonor—that I have not seen in your sufferings and mine.		
A4622	To me no word of our friends, Antigone, either bringing joy or bringing pain has come since we two were robbed of our two brothers who died in one day by a double blow		
A4623	Has not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honored burial, the other to unburied shame?  Eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and custom, he has laid in the earthfor his honor among the dead below.  As for the poor corpse of Polyneices, however, they say that an edict has been published to the townsmen that no one shall bury him or mourn him, but instead leave him unwept, unentombed, for the birds a pleasing storeas they look to satisfy their hunger.		
A4624	Has not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honored burial, the other to unburied shame?  Eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and custom, he has laid in the earthfor his honor among the dead below.		
A4625	my sister		
A4626	he is my brother, and yours too		
A4627	I will never be convicted of betraying him.		
A4628	because of the crimes that he himself detected		
A4629	ours is a woman's nature, and accordingly not suited to battles against men		
A4630	we are ruled by the more powerful, so that we must obey in these things and in things even more stinging		
A4631	I will bury him		
A4632	—it would honor me to die while doing that		
A4633	they say that an edict has been published to the townsmen		
A4634	Will you join your hand to mine in order to lift his corpse		
A4635	Consider whether you will share the toil and the task.		
A4636	For Zeus detests above all the boasts of a proud tongue		
A4637	And when he saw them advancing in a swollen flood,arrogant their clanging gold, he dashed with brandished fire one who was already starting to shout victory when he had reached our ramparts. Chorus Staggered, he fell to the earth with a crash,torch in hand, a man possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate.  But his threats did not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed each their own dooms with hard blows,Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point.		
A4638	But since Victory whose name is glory has come to us, smiling in joy equal to the joy of chariot-rich Thebes,let us make for ourselves forgetfulness after the recent wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long dance and song.  And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of Thebes, rule our dancing!		
A4639	I knew, first of all, how constant was your reverence for the power of the throne of Laius;  how, again, you were reverent, when Oedipus was guiding our city;  and lastly, how, when he was dead, you still maintained loyal thoughts towards his children.		
A4640	Now, it is impossible to know fully any man's character, will, or judgment, until he has been proved by the test of rule and law-giving.  For if anyone who directs the entire city does not cling to the best and wisest plans,but because of some fear keeps his lips locked, then, in my judgment, he is and has long been the most cowardly traitor.  And if any man thinks a friend more important than his fatherland, that man, I say, is of no account.  Zeus, god who sees all things always, be my witness—I would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety, marching upon the citizens.  Nor would I ever make a man who is hostile to my country a friend to myself, because I know this, that our country is the ship that bears us safe, and that only whenwe sail her on a straight course can we make true friends.  Such are the rules by which I strengthen this city.		
A4641	Eteocles, who fell fightingin behalf of our city and who excelled all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that descends to the noblest of the dead below.		
A4642	Eteocles, who fell fightingin behalf of our city and who excelled all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that descends to the noblest of the dead below.  But as for his brother, Polyneices, I mean, who on his return from exile wanted to burn to the groundthe city of his fathers and his race's gods, and wanted to feed on kindred blood and lead the remnant into slavery—it has been proclaimed to the city that no one shall give him funeral honors or lamentation,but all must leave him unburied and a sight of shame, with his body there for birds and dogs to eat.  This is my will, and never will I allow the traitor to stand in honor before the just.  But whoever has good will to Thebes,he shall be honored by me in death as in life.		
A4643	That is your will, Creon, towards this city's enemy and its friend.  And the power is yours, I believe, to make use of every law whatsoever, both concerning the dead and all us who live.		
A4644	Even if my report brings no good, still will I tell you,since I come with a good grip on one hope, that I can suffer nothing except what is my fate.		
A4645	If you do not find the very hand that made this burial, and reveal him before my eyes, mere death shall not suffice for you, not before, hung up alive, you have made this outrage plain,		
A4646	Perhaps, but never the author of this action. Creon Yes, and what is more, you sold your life for silver.		
A4647	This power spans the sea, even when it surges white before the gales of the south-wind, and makes a path under swells that threaten to engulf him.  Earth, too, the eldest of the gods, the immortal, the unwearied,he wears away to his own ends, turning the soil with the offspring of horses as the plows weave to and fro year after year.		
A4648	The light-hearted tribe of birdsand the clans of wild beasts and the sea-brood of the deep he snares in the meshes of his twisted nets, and he leads them captive, very-skilled man.  He masters by his artsthe beast who dwells in the wilds and roams the hills.  He tames the shaggy-maned horse, putting the yoke upon its neck, and tames the tireless mountain bull.		
A4649	Speech and thought fast as thewind and the moods that give order to a city he has taught himself, and how to flee the arrows of the inhospitable frost under clear skies and the arrows of the storming rain.He has resource for everything.  Lacking resource in nothing he strides towards what must come		
A4650	from baffling diseases he has devised flights.		
A4651	I could have vowed that I would not ever come here again, because of your threats by which I had just been storm-tossed.  But since this joy that exceeds and oversteps my hopes can be compared in fulness to no other pleasure		
A4652	So she, too, when she saw the corpse bare, broke into a cry of lamentation and cursed with harsh curses those who had done it.  Immediately she took thirsty dust in her hands,and from a pitcher of beaten bronze held high she crowned the dead with thrice-poured libations.		
A4653	We rushed forward when we saw it, and at once closed upon our quarry, who was not at all dismayed.  We then charged her with her past and present doings,but she made no denial of anything—at once to my joy and to my pain.  For to have escaped from trouble one's self gives the greatest joy, but it stings to lead friends to evil		
A4654	I declare it and make no denial.		
A4655	I knew it.  How could I not?		
A4656	Yes, since it was not Zeus that published me that edict, and since not of that kind are the laws which Justice who dwells with the gods below established among men.  Nor did I think that your decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override the unwrittenand unfailing statutes given us by the gods.  For their life is not of today or yesterday, but for all time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.  Not for fear of any man's pride was I about to owe a penalty to the gods for breaking these.		
A4657	In truth, then, I am no man, but she is,if this victory rests with her and brings no penalty		
A4658	All here would admit that they approve,if fear did not grip their tongues.  But tyranny, blest with so much else, has the power to do and say whatever it pleases.		
A4659	Creon You alone out of all these Thebans see it that way. Antigone They do, too, but for you they hold their tongues. Creon Are you not ashamed that your beliefs differ from theirs? Antigone No, there is nothing shameful in respecting your own flesh and blood.		
A4660	Creon You do not love someone you have hated, not even after death. Antigone It is not my nature to join in hate, but in love.		
A4661	While I live, no woman will rule me.		
A4662	Look, here comes Ismene from the palace, shedding the tears of a loving sister.  A cloud over her eyes mars her red-flushed face,and it breaks into rain on her comely cheek.		
A4663	Ismene I performed the deed—as long as she concurs—and I share and carry the burden of guilt. Antigone No, justice will not permit you to do this, since you were not willing to help with the deed, nor did I give you a part in it.		
A4664	Your power, great Zeus—what human overstepping can check it?  Yours is power that neither Sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods can defeat.  Unaged through time,you rule by your power and dwell thereby in the brilliant splendor of Olympus		
A4665	evil at one time or another seems good, to him whose mind a god leads to ruin.But for the briefest moment such a man fares free of destruction.		
A4666	in no way can we let a woman defeat us.  It is better to fall from power, if it is fated, by a man's hand,than that we be called weaker than women.		
A4667	No, whomever the city may appoint, that man must be obeyed in matters small and great and in matters just and unjust.		
A4668	For dread of your glance forbids the ordinary citizen to speak such words as would offend your ear.		
A4669	Haemon All the people of this city of Thebes deny it. Creon Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I must rule? Haemon See, there, how you have spoken so much like a child. Creon Am I to rule this land by the will of another than myself? Haemon That is no city, which belongs to one man. Creon Does not the city by tradition belong to the man in power? Haemon You would make a fine monarch in a desert.		
A4670	You do not respect them, when you trample on the gods' honors.		
A4671	But now, witnessing this, I too am carried beyond the bounds of loyalty.  The power fails me to keep back my streaming tears any longer, when I see Antigone making her way to the chamber where all are laid to rest,now her bridal chamber.		
A4672	by what laws I go to the rock-closed prison		
A4673	Your pious action shows a certain reverence, but an offence against power can no way be tolerated by him who has power in his keeping		
A4674	Your self-willed disposition is what has destroyed you		
A4675	Take her away—now!  And when you have enshrouded her, as I proclaimed, in her covered tomb, leave her alone, deserted—let her decide whether she wishes to die or to live entombed in such a home		
A4676	But now, Polyneices, it is for tending your corpse that I win such reward as this. [And yet I honored you rightly, as the wise understand.Never, if I had been a mother of children, or if a husband had been rotting after death, would I have taken that burden upon myself in violation of the citizens' will.  For the sake of what law, you ask, do I say that?  A husband lost, another might have been found,and if bereft of a child, there could be a second from some other man.  But when father and mother are hidden in  Hades, no brother could ever bloom for me again.  Such was the law whereby I held you first in honor, but for that Creon judged me guilty of wrongdoingand of dreadful outrage, dear brother!		
A4677	What ally should I call out to, when by my reverence I have earned a name for irreverence?Well, then, if these events please the gods, once I have suffered my doom I will come to know my guilt.  But if the guilt lies with my judges, I could wish for them no greater evils than they inflict unjustly on me.		
A4678	See what I suffer, and at whose hands, because I revered reverence!		
A4679	But dreadful is the mysterious power of fate—there is no deliverance from it by wealth or by war, by towered city, or dark, sea-beaten ships.		
A4680	And Dryas's son, the Edonian king swift to rage, was tamed in recompense for his frenzied insults, when, by the will of Dionysus, he was shut in a rocky prison.  There the fierce and swelling force of his madness trickled away.		
A4681	Teiresias —by how much the most precious of our possessions is the power to reason wisely? Creon By as much, I think, as senselessness is the greatest affliction.		
A4682	For these crimes the avenging destroyers,the Furies of Hades and of the gods, lie in ambush for you, waiting to seize you in these same sufferings.		
A4683	The man is gone, my king, leaving dire prophecies behind.  And for all the time that I have had this hair on my head, now white, once dark, I know that he has never been a false prophet to our city.		
A4684	For Creon, as I saw it, was once blest:  he had saved this land of Cadmus from its enemies;  and having won sole and total dominion in the land, he guided it on a straight course and flourished in his noble crop of children.And now all this has been lost.  When a man has forfeited his pleasures, I do not reckon his existence as life, but consider him just a breathing corpse.		
A4685	I will tell what I witnessed and leave no word of the truth unspoken.  For what good would it do that should I soothe you with words in which I must later be found false?The truth is always best.		
A4686	Wisdom is provided as the chief part of happiness		
A4687	our dealings with the gods must be in no way unholy.  The great words of arrogant men have to make repayment with great blows		
A4688	in old age teach wisdom.		
A4689	Do not, then, bear one mood only in yourself:  do not think that your word and no other, must be right.  For if any man thinks that he alone is wise—that in speech or in mind he has no peer—such a soul, when laid open, is always found empty.No, even when a man is wise, it brings him no shame to learn many things, and not to be too rigid.		
A4690	My king, my thoughts have long been deliberating whether this deed is somehow the work of gods?		
A4691	Saved just now beyond hope and belief, I owe the gods great thanks		
A4692	Chorus Love, the unconquered in battle, Love, you who descend upon riches, and watch the night through on a girl's soft cheek,you roam over the sea and among the homes of men in the wilds.  Neither can any immortal escape you,nor any man whose life lasts for a day.  He who has known you is driven to madness. Chorus You seize the minds of just men and drag them to injustice, to their ruin.  You it is who have incited this conflict of men whose flesh and blood are one.But victory belongs to radiant Desire swelling from the eyes of the sweet-bedded bride.  Desire sits enthroned in power beside the mighty laws.For in all this divine Aphrodite plays her irresistible game.		
A4693	I performed the deed—as long as she concurs—and I share and carry the burden of guilt. Antigone No, justice will not permit you to do this, since you were not willing to help with the deed, nor did I give you a part in it. Ismene		
A4694	But now with this sea of troubles around you, I am not ashamed to sail in a sea of suffering at your side.		
A4695	Nothing so evil as money ever grew to be current among men.  This destroys cities, this drives men from their homes, this trains and warps honest minds to set themselves to works of shame,this teaches people to practise villainies, and to know every act of unholiness.		
A4696	Possessing resourceful skill, a subtlety beyond expectation		
A4697	In none of your maximsis there anything that pleases me—and may there never be!  Similarly to you as well my views must be displeasing		
A4698	They say that he does not conduct this business lightly,but whoever performs any of these rites, for him the fate appointed is death by public stoning among the entire city.		
A4699	This is how things stand for you, and so you will soon show your nature, whether you are noble-minded, or the corrupt daughter of a noble line.		
A4700	Will you join your hand to mine in order to lift his corpse? Ismene You plan to bury him—when it is forbidden to the city?		
A4701	Yes, he is my brother, and yours too, even if you wish it otherwise.  I will never be convicted of betraying him.		
A4702	Yes, he is my brother, and yours too, even if you wish it otherwise.  I will never be convicted of betraying him. Ismene Hard girl!  Even when Creon has forbidden it? Antigone No, he has no right to keep me from my own.		
A4703	Think, sister, how our fatherperished in hatred and infamy, when, because of the crimes that he himself detected, he smashed both his eyes with self-blinding hand;  then his mother-wife, two names in one, with a twisted noose destroyed her life;lastly, our two brothers in a single day, both unhappy murderers of their own flesh and blood, worked with mutual hands their common doom.		
A4704	And now we, in turn—we two who have been left all alone—consider how much more miserably we will be destroyed, if in defiance of the lawwe transgress against an autocrat's decree or his powers.		
A4705	No, we must remember, first, that ours is a woman's nature, and accordingly not suited to battles against men;		
A4706	No, we must remember, first, that ours is a woman's nature, and accordingly not suited to battles against men;  and next, that we are ruled by the more powerful, so that we must obey in these things and in things even more stinging.I, therefore, will ask those below for pardon, since I am forced to this, and will obey those who have come to authority.  It is foolish to do what is fruitless.		
A4707	I will bury him—it would honor me to die while doing that.  I shall rest with him, loved one with loved one, a pious criminal.  For the time is greaterthat I must serve the dead than the living, since in that world I will rest forever.  But if you so choose, continue to dishonor what the gods in honor have established.		
A4708	I do them no dishonor.  But to act in violation of the citizens' will—of that I am by nature incapable.		
A4709	You can make that your pretext!  Regardless, I will go now to heap a tomb over the brother I love. Ismene Oh no, unhappy sister!  I fear for you!		
A4710	No, we must remember, first, that ours is a woman's nature, and accordingly not suited to battles against men		
A4711	But leave me and the foolish plan I have authored to suffer this terrible thing, for I will not suffer anything so terrible that my death will lack honor.		
A4712	Go, then, if you so decide.  And of this be sure:  though your path is foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and true.		
A4713	And of this be sure:  though your path is foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and true.		
A4714	For Zeus detests above all the boasts of a proud tongue.  And when he saw them advancing in a swollen flood,arrogant their clanging gold, he dashed with brandished fire one who was already starting to shout victory when he had reached our ramparts.		
A4715	all but the accursed pair who, born of one father and onemother, set against each other their spears, both victorious, and who now share in a common death.		
A4716	I now possess all the power and the throne according to my kinship with the dead.Now, it is impossible to know fully any man's character, will, or judgment, until he has been proved by the test of rule and law-giving.		
A4717	For if anyone who directs the entire city does not cling to the best and wisest plans,but because of some fear keeps his lips locked, then, in my judgment, he is and has long been the most cowardly traitor.		
A4718	And if any man thinks a friend more important than his fatherland, that man, I say, is of no account.		
A4719	Nor would I ever make a man who is hostile to my country a friend to myself, because I know this, that our country is the ship that bears us safe, and that only whenwe sail her on a straight course can we make true friends.  Such are the rules by which I strengthen this city.		
A4720	t has been proclaimed to the city that no one shall give him funeral honors or lamentation,but all must leave him unburied and a sight of shame, with his body there for birds and dogs to eat.		
A4721	This is my will, and never will I allow the traitor to stand in honor before the just.  But whoever has good will to Thebes,he shall be honored by me in death as in life.		
A4722	This is my will, and never will I allow the traitor to stand in honor before the just.		
A4723	Chorus Then what is this other command that you would give? Creon That you not give way to the breakers of my commands. Chorus There is no one so foolish as to crave death.		
A4724	My king, I will not say that I arrive breathless because of speed, or from the action of a swift foot.For often I brought myself to a stop because of my thoughts, and wheeled round in my path to return.  My mind was telling me many things:  “Fool, why do you go to where your arrival will mean your punishment?”  “Idiot, are you dallying again?  If Creon learns it from another, must you not suffer for it?”So debating, I made my way unhurriedly, slow, and thus a short road was made long.		
A4725	You say what is intolerable when you claim that the gods have concern for that corpse.  Was it in high esteem for his benefactionsthat they sought to hide him, when he had come to burn their columned shrines, their sacred treasures and their land, and scatter its laws to the winds?  Or do you see the gods honoring the wicked?  It cannot be.		
A4726	By those men, I am certain, they were led astray and bribed to do this deed.Nothing so evil as money ever grew to be current among men.  This destroys cities, this drives men from their homes, this trains and warps honest minds to set themselves to works of shame,this teaches people to practise villainies, and to know every act of unholiness.		
A4727	But all the men who did this job for hire have made sure that, sooner or later, they shall suffer the punishment.		
A4728	If you do not find the very hand that made this burial, and reveal him before my eyes, mere death shall not suffice for you, not before, hung up alive, you have made this outrage plain,so that hereafter you may thieve with better knowledge of where your money should be received from, and learn that it is best not to be fond of money-making from any and every source.  For you will find that ill-gotten gains bring more men to ruin than to safety.		
A4729	Speech and thought fast as thewind and the moods that give order to a city he has taught himself, and how to flee the arrows of the inhospitable frost under clear skies and the arrows of the storming rain.He has resource for everything.		
A4730	Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man.This power spans the sea, even when it surges white before the gales of the south-wind, and makes a path under swells that threaten to engulf him.  Earth, too, the eldest of the gods, the immortal, the unwearied,he wears away to his own ends, turning the soil with the offspring of horses as the plows weave to and fro year after year.		
A4731	Lacking resource in nothing he strides towards what must come.  From Death alone he shall procure no escape, but from baffling diseases he has devised flights.		
A4732	Possessing resourceful skill, a subtlety beyond expectation he moves now to evil, now to good.  When he honors the laws of the land and the justice of the gods to which he is bound by oath,his city prospers.  But banned from his city is he who, thanks to his rashness, couples with disgrace.  Never may he share my home,never think my thoughts, who does these things!		
A4733	Possessing resourceful skill, a subtlety beyond expectation he moves now to evil, now to good.  When he honors the laws of the land and the justice of the gods to which he is bound by oath,his city prospers.		
A4734	Creon You, you with your face bent to the ground, do you admit, or deny that you did this? Antigone I declare it and make no denial.		
A4735	To Antigone. You, however, tell me—not at length, but briefly—did you know that an edict had forbidden this? Antigone I knew it.  How could I not?  It was public. Creon And even so you dared overstep that law? Antigone Yes, since it was not Zeus that published me that edict, and since not of that kind are the laws which Justice who dwells with the gods below established among men.  Nor did I think that your decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override the unwrittenand unfailing statutes given us by the gods.  For their life is not of today or yesterday, but for all time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.  Not for fear of any man's pride was I about to owe a penalty to the gods for breaking these.		
A4736	Die I must, that I knew well （how could I not?）.  That is true even without your edicts.  But if I am to die before my time, I count that a gain.  When anyone lives as I do, surrounded by evils, how can he not carry off gain by dying?So for me to meet this doom is a grief of no account.		
A4737	But if I had endured that my mother's son should in death lie an unburied corpse, that would have grieved me.  Yet for this, I am not grieved.		
A4738	And if my present actions are foolish in your sight,it may be that it is a fool who accuses me of folly.		
A4739	Yet remember that over-hard spirits most often collapse.  It is the stiffest iron, baked toutter hardness in the fire, that you most often see snapped and shivered.  And I have witnessed horses with great spirit disciplined by a small bit.  For there is no place for pride, when one is his neighbors' slave.		
A4740	his girl was already practiced in outrage when she overstepped the published laws.  And, that done, this now is a second outrage, that she glories in it and exults in her deed.  In truth, then, I am no man, but she is,if this victory rests with her and brings no penalty.  No!  Whether she is my sister's child, or nearer to me in blood than any of my kin that worship Zeus at the altar of our house, she and her sister will not escape a doom most harsh.		
A4741	This girl was already practiced in outrage when she overstepped the published laws.  And, that done, this now is a second outrage, that she glories in it and exults in her deed.  In truth, then, I am no man, but she is,if this victory rests with her and brings no penalty.		
A4742	Why then do you wait?  In none of your maximsis there anything that pleases me—and may there never be!  Similarly to you as well my views must be displeasing.  And yet, how could I have won a nobler glory than by giving burial to my own brother?		
A4743	Creon You alone out of all these Thebans see it that way. Antigone They do, too, but for you they hold their tongues.		
A4744	Creon Are you not ashamed that your beliefs differ from theirs? Antigone No, there is nothing shameful in respecting your own flesh and blood. Creon Was not he your brother too, who died in the opposite cause? Antigone A brother by the same mother and the same father. Creon Why, then, do you pay a service that is disrespectful to him?		
A4745	Antigone The dead man will not support you in that. Creon Yes, he will, if you honor him equally with the wicked one. Antigone It was his brother, not his slave, who died. Creon But he died ravaging this land, while he fell in its defense. Antigone Hades craves these rites, nevertheless. Creon But the good man craves a portion not equal to the evil's. Antigone Who knows but that these actions are pure to those below?		
A4746	It is not my nature to join in hate, but in love.		
A4747	Then, go down to hell and love themif you must.  While I live, no woman will rule me.		
A4748	While I live, no woman will rule me		
A4749	Antigone Save yourself.  I do not grudge your escape. Ismene Ah, misery!  Will I fall short of sharing your fate? Antigone Your choice was to live, it was mine to die. Ismene At least your choice was not made without my protests. Antigone One world approved your wisdom, another approved mine. Ismene Nevertheless, the offense is identical for both of us. Antigone Take heart!  You live.  But my life has long beenin Death's hands so that I might serve the dead.		
A4750	Ismene Yes, Creon.  Whatever amount of reason nature may have given them does not remain with those in dire straits, but goes astray. Creon Yours did, I know, when you chose dire actions with dire allies. Ismene What life would there be for me alone, without her presence?		
A4751	Antigone Haemon, dearest!  How your father wrongs you! Creon Enough!  Enough of you and of your marriage!		
A4752	No more delay!  Servants, take them inside!  Hereafter they must be women, and not left at large.For it is known that even the brave seek to flee, when they see Death now closing on their life.		
A4753	Hereafter they must be women, and not left at large.		
A4754	Blest are those whose days have not tasted of evil.  For when a house has once been shaken by the gods,no form of ruin is lacking, but it spreads over the bulk of the race, just as, when the surge is driven over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of Thracian sea-winds,it rolls up the black sand from the depths, and the wind-beaten headlands that front the blows of the storm give out a mournful roar.		
A4755	Your power, great Zeus—what human overstepping can check it?  Yours is power that neither Sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods can defeat.  Unaged through time,you rule by your power and dwell thereby in the brilliant splendor of Olympus.  And through the future, both near and distant, as through the past, shall this law prevail:  nothing that is vast comes to the life of mortals without ruin.		
A4756	See how that hope whose wanderings are so wide truly is a benefit to many men, but to an equal number it is a false lure of light-headed desires.  The deception comes to one who is wholly unawares until he burns his foot on a hot fire.For with wisdom did someone once reveal the maxim, now famous, that evil at one time or another seems good, to him whose mind a god leads to ruin.But for the briefest moment such a man fares free of destruction.		
A4757	No marriage will be deemed by me more important than your good guidance.		
A4758	It is for this that men pray:  to sire and raise in their homes children who are obedient, that they may requite their father's enemy with evil and honor his friend, just as their father does.But the man who begets unhelpful children—what would you say that he has sown except miseries for himself and abundant exultation for his enemies?  Never, then, my son, banish your reason for pleasure on account of a woman,knowing that this embrace soon becomes cold and brittle—an evil woman to share your bed and home.		
A4759	For what wound could strike deeper than a false friend?  No, spit her out as if she were an enemy, let her go find a husband in Hades.		
A4760	For whoever shows his excellence in the case of his own household will be found righteous in his city as well.  But if anyone oversteps and does violence to the laws, or thinks to dictate to those in power,such a one will never win praise from me.		
A4761	No, whomever the city may appoint, that man must be obeyed in matters small and great and in matters just and unjust.  And I would feel confident that such a man would be a fine ruler no less than a good and willing subject,and that beneath a hail of spears he would stand his ground where posted, a loyal and brave comrade in the battle line.  But there is no evil worse than disobedience.  This destroys cities;  this overturns homes;  this breaksthe ranks of allied spears into headlong rout.		
A4762	But the lives of men who prosper upright, of these obedience has saved the greatest part.  Therefore we must defend those who respect order, and in no way can we let a woman defeat us.		
A4763	Therefore we must defend those who respect order, and in no way can we let a woman defeat us.  It is better to fall from power, if it is fated, by a man's hand,than that we be called weaker than women.		
A4764	Father, the gods implant reason in men, the highest of all things that we call our own.		
A4765	But I can hear these murmurs in the dark, how the city moans for this girl, saying:  “No woman ever merited death less—none ever died so shamefully for deeds so glorious as hers, who, when her own brother had fallen in bloody battle, would not leave him unburied to be devoured by savage dogs, or by any bird.  Does she not deserve to receive golden honor?		
A4766	For if any man thinks that he alone is wise—that in speech or in mind he has no peer—such a soul, when laid open, is always found empty.No, even when a man is wise, it brings him no shame to learn many things, and not to be too rigid.		
A4767	For if even from me, a younger man, a worthy thought may be supplied,by far the best thing, I believe, would be for men to be all-wise by nature.  Otherwise—since most often it does not turn out that way—it is good to learn in addition from those who advise you well.		
A4768	For if any man thinks that he alone is wise—that in speech or in mind he has no peer—such a soul, when laid open, is always found empty.No, even when a man is wise, it brings him no shame to learn many things, and not to be too rigid.  You see how the trees that stand beside the torrential streams created by a winter storm yield to it and save their branches, while the stiff and rigid perish root and all?And in the same way the pilot who keeps the sheet of his sail taut and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and voyages thereafter with his decking underwater.  Father, give way and allow a change from your rage.  For if even from me, a younger man, a worthy thought may be supplied,by far the best thing, I believe, would be for men to be all-wise by nature.  Otherwise—since most often it does not turn out that way—it is good to learn in addition from those who advise you well		
A4769	Creon Men of my age—are we, then, to be schooled in wisdom by men of his? Haemon Not in anything that is not right.  But if I am young, you should look to my conduct, not to my years.		
A4770	Haemon All the people of this city of Thebes deny it. Creon Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I must rule? Haemon See, there, how you have spoken so much like a child. Creon Am I to rule this land by the will of another than myself? Haemon That is no city, which belongs to one man.		
A4771	That is no city, which belongs to one man.		
A4772	Creon Does not the city by tradition belong to the man in power? Haemon You would make a fine monarch in a desert.		
A4773	Creon This boy seems to be fighting on the side of the woman. Haemon If you are a woman, for, to be sure, my concern is for you.		
A4774	Creon You traitor, attacking your father, accusing him! Haemon Because I see you making a mistake and committing injustice. Creon Am I making a mistake when I respect my own prerogatives? Haemon Yes.  You do not respect them, when you trample on the gods' honors.		
A4775	reon Polluted creature, submitting to a woman! Haemon You will never catch me submitting to shamelessness. Creon You do.  Your every word, after all, pleads her case. Haemon And yours, and mine, and that of gods below. Creon You can never marry her, not while she is still alive. Haemon Then she will die, and in death destroy another.		
A4776	Creon Is that so?  By Olympus above—know this well—you will have no joy for taunting me over and above your censures.Bring out that hated thing, so that with him looking on she may die right now in her bridegroom's presence and at his side! Haemon No, not at my side will she die—do not ever imagine it.  Nor shall you ever look at me and set eyes on my face again.Indulge in your madness now with whomever of your friends can endure it.		
A4777	Love, the unconquered in battle, Love, you who descend upon riches, and watch the night through on a girl's soft cheek,you roam over the sea and among the homes of men in the wilds.  Neither can any immortal escape you,nor any man whose life lasts for a day.  He who has known you is driven to madness.		
A4778	You seize the minds of just men and drag them to injustice, to their ruin.  You it is who have incited this conflict of men whose flesh and blood are one.But victory belongs to radiant Desire swelling from the eyes of the sweet-bedded bride.  Desire sits enthroned in power beside the mighty laws.For in all this divine Aphrodite plays her irresistible game.		
A4779	Ah, misery!I have no home among men or with the shades, no home with the living or with the dead.		
A4780	You have rushed headlong to the far limits of daring, and against the high throne of Justiceyou have fallen, my daughter, fallen heavily.  But in this ordeal you are paying for some paternal crime.		
A4781	You have touched on my most bitter thoughtand moved my ever-renewed pity for my father and for the entire doom ordained for us, the famed house of Labdacus.  Oh, the horrors of our mother's bed!  Oh, the slumbers of the wretched mother at the sideof her own son, my own father!  What manner of parents gave me my miserable being!  It is to them that I go like this, accursed and unwed, to share their home.		
A4782	Unwept, unfriended, without marriage-song, I am led in misery on this journey that cannot be put off.  No longer is it permitted me, unhappy girl,to look up at this sacred eye of the burning sun.  But for my fate no tear is shed, no friend moans in sorrow.		
A4783	For, when each of you died, with my own hands I washed and dressed you and poured drink-offerings at your graves.  But now, Polyneices, it is for tending your corpse that I win such reward as this. [And yet I honored you rightly, as the wise understand.Never, if I had been a mother of children, or if a husband had been rotting after death, would I have taken that burden upon myself in violation of the citizens' will.  For the sake of what law, you ask, do I say that?  A husband lost, another might have been found,and if bereft of a child, there could be a second from some other man.  But when father and mother are hidden in  Hades, no brother could ever bloom for me again.  Such was the law whereby I held you first in honor, but for that Creon judged me guilty of wrongdoingand of dreadful outrage, dear brother!		
A4784	Such was the law whereby I held you first in honor, but for that Creon judged me guilty of wrongdoingand of dreadful outrage, dear brother!  And now he leads me thus in his hands' strong grasp, when I have enjoyed no marriage bed or bridal song and have not received any portion of marriage or the nurture of children.  But deserted by friends,in misery I go living to the hollow graves of the dead.]  What law of the gods have I transgressed?  Why should I look to the gods anymore?		
A4785	O city of my fathers, land of Thebes, and you gods, our ancestors!  I am led away now; there is no more delay!Look at me, you who are Thebes' lords—look at the only remaining daughter of the house of your kings.  See what I suffer, and at whose hands, because I revered reverence!		
A4786	Think, therefore, on these things, my son.  All men are liable to err.But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not remain stubborn.  Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.		
A4787	Concede the claim of the dead.  Do not kick at the fallen.What prowess is it to kill the dead all over again?  I have considered for your good, and what I advise is good.  The sweetest thing is to learn from a good advisor when his advice is to your profit.		
A4788	Turn your profits, make your deals for the white gold of Sardis and the gold of India, if it pleases you, but you shall not cover that man with a grave,not even if the eagles of Zeus wish to snatch and carry him to be devoured at the god's throne.  No, not even then, for fear of that defilement will I permit his burial, since I know with certainty that no mortal has the power to defile the gods.But even the exceedingly clever, old Teiresias, falls with a shameful fall, when they couch shameful thoughts in fine phrasing for profit's sake		
A4789	I have considered for your good, and what I advise is good.  The sweetest thing is to learn from a good advisor when his advice is to your profit.		
A4790	by how much the most precious of our possessions is the power to reason wisely?		
A4791	Teiresias And the race sprung from tyrants loves shameful gain. Creon Do you know that you ramble so about your king? Teiresias I am aware, since through me you have saved this city. Creon You are a wise seer, but fond of doing injustice. Teiresias You will stir me to utter the dire secret in my soul. Creon Out with it!  But only if it is not for gain that you speak it. Teiresias Indeed, I think I speak without mention of gain—where you are concerned. Creon Be certain that you will not trade in my will.		
A4792	In the dead you have no part, nor do the gods above, but in this you do them violence.		
A4793	In the dead you have no part, nor do the gods above, but in this you do them violence.  For these crimes the avenging destroyers,the Furies of Hades and of the gods, lie in ambush for you, waiting to seize you in these same sufferings.		
A4794	A time not long to be delayed will reveal in your house wailing over men and over women.All the cities are stirred up in hostility, whose mangled corpses the dogs, or the wild beasts or some winged bird buried, carrying an unholy stench to the city that held each man's hearth.  There, now, are arrows for your heart, since you provoke me,launched at you, archer-like, in my anger.		
A4795	To yield is terrible, but, to resist, to strike my pride with ruin—this, too, inspires terror.		
A4796	The moment, Creon, requires that you reason wisely.		
A4797	Think, therefore, on these things, my son.  All men are liable to err.But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not remain stubborn.  Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.  Concede the claim of the dead.  Do not kick at the fallen.What prowess is it to kill the dead all over again?  I have considered for your good, and what I advise is good.  The sweetest thing is to learn from a good advisor when his advice is to your profit		
A4798	reon And you recommend this?  You think that I should yield? Chorus Yes, my king, and with all possible speed.  For harms sent from the gods swiftly cut short the follies of men.		
A4799	Ah, it is a struggle, but I depart from my heart's resolve and obey.  We must not wage vain wars with necessity.		
A4800	But since my judgment has taken this turn, I will be there to set her free, as I myself confined her.  I am held by the fear that it is best to keep the established laws to life's very end.		
A4801	O Leader of the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire, overseer of the chants in the night, son begotten of Zeus,appear, my king, with your attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance and sing you as Iacchus the Giver!		
A4802	Still conscious, he clasped the maiden in his faint embrace, and, as he gasped, he shot onto her pale cheek a swift stream of oozing blood.Corpse enfolding corpse he lay, having won his marriage rites,		
A4803	poor boy, not here, but in Hades' palace, and having shown to mankind by how much the failure to reason wisely is the most severe of all afflictions assigned to man.		
A4804	Ah, the blunders of an unthinking mind, blunders of rigidity, yielding death!  Oh, you witnesses of the killers and the killed, both of one family!What misery arises from my reasonings!  Haemon, you have died after a young life, youngest and last of my sons!  O God!  You have departed not by your foolishness, but by my own!		
A4805	God, I have mastered the bitter lesson!  But then, then, I think, some god struck me on my head with a crushing weight, and drove me into savage paths,—ah!—and overthrew my joy to be trampled on!  Ah, the labors men must toil through!		
A4806	O harbor of Hades, hard to purify!Why, why do you ruin me?  Herald of evil, of grief, what word do you say?  Ah, you have done in a dead man anew!  What are you saying, boy?  What is this you report to meGod no!—what new slaughter, my wife's doom, is heaped upon this ruin?		
A4807	There I see a new, a second evil!  What destiny, ah, what, can still await me?  I have just now taken my son in my arms, and now I see another corpse before me!Oh, tormented mother!  Oh, my son!		
A4808	Creon Ah this guilt can never be fastened onto any other mortal so as to remove my own!  It was I, yes, I, who killed you, I the wretch.I admit the truth.  Lead me away, my servants, lead me from here with all haste, who am no more than a dead man!		
A4809	These things are in the future.  We must see to present affairs.Fulfillment of these things rests in the hands where it should rest. Creon All that I crave was summed in that prayer. Chorus Then pray no more; for mortals have no release from destined misfortune.		
A4810	Wisdom is provided as the chief part of happiness, and our dealings with the gods must be in no way unholy.  The great words of arrogant men have to make repayment with great blows, and in old age teach wisdom.		
A4811	Wisdom is provided as the chief part of happiness, and our dealings with the gods must be in no way unholy.		
A4812	No, we must remember, first, that ours is a woman's nature, and accordingly not suited to battles against men;  and next, that we are ruled by the more powerful, so that we must obey in these things and in things even more stinging.I, therefore, will ask those below for pardon, since I am forced to this, and will obey those who have come to authority.  It is foolish to do what is fruitless. Antigone		
A4813	Ismene I do them no dishonor.  But to act in violation of the citizens' will—of that I am by nature incapable.		
A4814	Ismene You have a hot heart for chilling deeds. Antigone I know that I please those whom I am most bound to please. Ismene Yes, if you will also have the power.  But you crave the impossible.		
A4815	Staggered, he fell to the earth with a crash,torch in hand, a man possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate.  But his threats did not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed each their own dooms with hard blows,Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point.		
A4816	smene, my sister, true child of my own mother		
A4817	To me no word of our friends, Antigone, either bringing joy or bringing pain has come since we two were robbed of our two brothers who died in one day by a double blow.		
A4818	Has not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honored burial, the other to unburied shame?		
A4819	Eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and custom, he has laid in the earthfor his honor among the dead below.  As for the poor corpse of Polyneices, however, they say that an edict has been published to the townsmen that no one shall bury him or mourn him, but instead leave him unwept, unentombed, for the birds a pleasing storeas they look to satisfy their hunger.		
A4820	You plan to bury him—when it is forbidden to the city?		
A4821	Ah, no!  Think, sister, how our fatherperished in hatred and infamy, when, because of the crimes that he himself detected, he smashed both his eyes with self-blinding hand;		
A4822	consider how much more miserably we will be destroyed, if in defiance of the lawwe transgress against an autocrat's decree or his powers.		
A4823	and next, that we are ruled by the more powerful, so that we must obey in these things and in things even more stinging.I, therefore, will ask those below for pardon, since I am forced to this, and will obey those who have come to authority.  It is foolish to do what is fruitless.		
A4824	Antigone You can make that your pretext!  Regardless, I will go now to heap a tomb over the brother I love. Ismene Oh no, unhappy sister!  I fear for you!		
A4825	You have a hot heart for chilling deeds.		
A4826	I know that I please those whom I am most bound to please.		
A4827	Yes, if you will also have the power.  But you crave the impossible.		
A4828	If you mean that, you will have my hatred, and you will be subject to punishment as the enemy of the dead.But leave me and the foolish plan I have authored to suffer this terrible thing, for I will not suffer anything so terrible that my death will lack honor.		
A4829	Go, then, if you so decide.  And of this be sure:  though your path is foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and true		
A4830	But since Victory whose name is glory has come to us, smiling in joy equal to the joy of chariot-rich Thebes,let us make for ourselves forgetfulness after the recent wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long dance and song.		
A4831	And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of Thebes, rule our dancing!		
A4832	Zeus, god who sees all things always, be my witness—I would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety, marching upon the citizens.  Nor would I ever make a man who is hostile to my country a friend to myself, because I know this, that our country is the ship that bears us safe, and that only whenwe sail her on a straight course can we make true friends.  Such are the rules by which I strengthen this city.		
A4833	Eteocles, who fell fightingin behalf of our city and who excelled all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that descends to the noblest of the dead below.  But as for his brother, Polyneices, I mean, who on his return from exile wanted to burn to the groundthe city of his fathers and his race's gods, and wanted to feed on kindred blood and lead the remnant into slavery—it has been proclaimed to the city that no one shall give him funeral honors or lamentation,but all must leave him unburied and a sight of shame, with his body there for birds and dogs to eat.		
A4834	never will I allow the traitor to stand in honor before the just.  But whoever has good will to Thebes,he shall be honored by me in death as in life.		
A4835	My mind was telling me many things:  “Fool, why do you go to where your arrival will mean your punishment?”  “Idiot, are you dallying again?  If Creon learns it from another, must you not suffer for it?”So debating, I made my way unhurriedly, slow, and thus a short road was made long.  At last, however, the view prevailed that I should come here—to you.		
A4836	You say what is intolerable when you claim that the gods have concern for that corpse.  Was it in high esteem for his benefactionsthat they sought to hide him, when he had come to burn their columned shrines, their sacred treasures and their land, and scatter its laws to the winds?  Or do you see the gods honoring the wicked?  It cannot be.  No!		
A4837	For you will find that ill-gotten gains bring more men to ruin than to safety.		
A4838	Creon Yes, and what is more, you sold your life for silver. Guard Ah!  It is truly sad when the judge judges wrong .		
A4839	Saved just now beyond hope and belief, I owe the gods great thanks.		
A4840	But banned from his city is he who, thanks to his rashness, couples with disgrace.  Never may he share my home,never think my thoughts, who does these things!		
A4841	I could have vowed that I would not ever come here again, because of your threats by which I had just been storm-tossed.  But since this joy that exceeds and oversteps my hopes can be compared in fulness to no other pleasure,		
A4842	We rushed forward when we saw it, and at once closed upon our quarry, who was not at all dismayed.  We then charged her with her past and present doings,but she made no denial of anything—at once to my joy and to my pain.  For to have escaped from trouble one's self gives the greatest joy, but it stings to lead friends to evil.		
A4843	You, however, tell me—not at length, but briefly—did you know that an edict had forbidden this? Antigone I knew it.  How could I not?  It was public. Creon And even so you dared overstep that law?		
A4844	over-hard spirits most often collapse.  It is the stiffest iron, baked toutter hardness in the fire, that you most often see snapped and shivered.  And I have witnessed horses with great spirit disciplined by a small bit.  For there is no place for pride, when one is his neighbors' slave.		
A4845	This girl was already practiced in outrage when she overstepped the published laws.  And, that done, this now is a second outrage, that she glories in it and exults in her deed.  In truth, then, I am no man, but she is,if this victory rests with her and brings no penalty.  No!  Whether she is my sister's child, or nearer to me in blood than any of my kin that worship Zeus at the altar of our house, she and her sister will not escape a doom most harsh.		
A4846	And yet, how could I have won a nobler glory than by giving burial to my own brother?		
A4847	But the good man craves a portion not equal to the evil's.		
A4848	One world approved your wisdom, another approved mine.		
A4849	Creon Yours did, I know, when you chose dire actions with dire allies. Ismene What life would there be for me alone, without her presence?		
A4850	Never, then, my son, banish your reason for pleasure on account of a woman,knowing that this embrace soon becomes cold and brittle—an evil woman to share your bed and home.  For what wound could strike deeper than a false friend?		
A4851	But the lives of men who prosper upright, of these obedience has saved the greatest part.		
A4852	But I can hear these murmurs in the dark, how the city moans for this girl, saying:  “No woman ever merited death less—none ever died so shamefully for deeds so glorious as hers, who, when her own brother had fallen in bloody battle, would not leave him unburied to be devoured by savage dogs, or by any bird.  Does she not deserve to receive golden honor?”Such is the rumor shrouded in darkness that silently spreads.  For me, father, no treasure is more precious than your prosperity.  What, indeed, is a nobler ornament for children than the fair fame of a thriving father, or for a father than that of his children?Do not, then, bear one mood only in yourself:  do not think that your word and no other, must be right.		
A4853	Haemon All the people of this city of Thebes deny it. Creon Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I must rule? Haemon See, there, how you have spoken so much like a child. Creon Am I to rule this land by the will of another than myself?		
A4854	Creon You can never marry her, not while she is still alive. Haemon Then she will die, and in death destroy another.		
A4855	horus Love, the unconquered in battle, Love, you who descend upon riches, and watch the night through on a girl's soft cheek,you roam over the sea and among the homes of men in the wilds.  Neither can any immortal escape you,nor any man whose life lasts for a day.  He who has known you is driven to madness. Chorus You seize the minds of just men and drag them to injustice, to their ruin.  You it is who have incited this conflict of men whose flesh and blood are one.But victory belongs to radiant Desire swelling from the eyes of the sweet-bedded bride.  Desire sits enthroned in power beside the mighty laws.For in all this divine Aphrodite plays her irresistible game.		
A4856	Ah, you mock me!  In the name of our fathers' gods,why do you not wait to abuse me until after I have gone, and not to my face, O my city, and you, her wealthy citizens?  Ah, spring of Dirce, and you holy ground of Thebes whose chariots are many,you, at least, will bear me witness how unwept by loved ones, and by what laws I go to the rock-closed prison of my unheard-of tomb!  Ah, misery!I have no home among men or with the shades, no home with the living or with the dead.		
A4857	ou have rushed headlong to the far limits of daring, and against the high throne of Justiceyou have fallen, my daughter, fallen heavily.  But in this ordeal you are paying for some paternal crime.		
A4858	Your pious action shows a certain reverence, but an offence against power can no way be tolerated by him who has power in his keeping.Your self-willed disposition is what has destroyed you.		
A4859	Take her away—now!  And when you have enshrouded her, as I proclaimed, in her covered tomb, leave her alone, deserted—let her decide whether she wishes to die or to live entombed in such a home.		
A4860	What law of the gods have I transgressed?  Why should I look to the gods anymore?  What ally should I call out to, when by my reverence I have earned a name for irreverence?Well, then, if these events please the gods, once I have suffered my doom I will come to know my guilt.  But if the guilt lies with my judges, I could wish for them no greater evils than they inflict unjustly on me.		
A4861	So too endured Danae in her beauty to changethe light of the sky for brass-bound walls, and in that chamber, both burial and bridal, she was held in strict confinement.  And yet was she of esteemed lineage, my daughter,and guarded a deposit of the seed of Zeus that had fallen in a golden rain.  But dreadful is the mysterious power of fate—there is no deliverance from it by wealth or by war, by towered city, or dark, sea-beaten ships.		
A4862	And Dryas's son, the Edonian king swift to rage, was tamed in recompense for his frenzied insults, when, by the will of Dionysus, he was shut in a rocky prison.  There the fierce and swelling force of his madness trickled away.That man came to know the god whom in his frenzy he had provoked with mockeries.  For he had sought to quell the god-inspired women and the Bacchanalian fire,and he angered the Muses who love the flute.		
A4863	All men are liable to err.But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not remain stubborn.  Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.		
A4864	Think, therefore, on these things, my son.  All men are liable to err.But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not remain stubborn.  Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.  Concede the claim of the dead.  Do not kick at the fallen.What prowess is it to kill the dead all over again?  I have considered for your good, and what I advise is good.  The sweetest thing is to learn from a good advisor when his advice is to your profit.		
A4865	Old man, you all shoot your arrows at me, like archers at their mark, and I am not safeeven from the plottings of the seer's divine art, but by their tribe I have long been bought and sold and made their merchandise.  Turn your profits, make your deals for the white gold of Sardis and the gold of India, if it pleases you, but you shall not cover that man with a grave,not even if the eagles of Zeus wish to snatch and carry him to be devoured at the god's throne.  No, not even then, for fear of that defilement will I permit his burial, since I know with certainty that no mortal has the power to defile the gods.But even the exceedingly clever, old Teiresias, falls with a shameful fall, when they couch shameful thoughts in fine phrasing for profit's sake.		
A4866	You will not live through many morecourses of the sun's swift chariot, before you will give in return one sprung from your own loins, a corpse in requital for corpses.		
A4867	For you have thrust below one of those of the upper air and irreverently lodged a living soul in the grave,while you detain in this world that which belongs to the infernal gods, a corpse unburied, unmourned, unholy.  In the dead you have no part, nor do the gods above, but in this you do them violence.  For these crimes the avenging destroyers,the Furies of Hades and of the gods, lie in ambush for you, waiting to seize you in these same sufferings.		
A4868	For harms sent from the gods swiftly cut short the follies of men.		
A4869	We must not wage vain wars with necessity.		
A4870	Thebes of all cities you hold foremost in honor, together with your lightning-struck mother.And now when the whole city is held subject to a violent plague, come, we ask, with purifying feet over steep Parnassus,or over the groaning straits!		
A4871	Leader of the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire, overseer of the chants in the night, son begotten of Zeus,appear, my king, with your attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance and sing you as Iacchus the Giver!		
A4872	Fortune sets upright and Fortune sinks the lucky and unlucky from day to day,and no one can prophesy to men concerning the order that has just been established.		
A4873	But if there is no joyalong with all of that, I would not pay even the shadow of smoke for all the rest, compared with joy.		
A4874	For what good would it do that should I soothe you with words in which I must later be found false?The truth is always best.		
A4875	having shown to mankind by how much the failure to reason wisely is the most severe of all afflictions assigned to man		
A4876	Ah, how late you seem to see the right!		
A4877	Ah, misery!There I see a new, a second evil!  What destiny, ah, what, can still await me?  I have just now taken my son in my arms, and now I see another corpse before me!Oh, tormented mother!  Oh, my son!		
A4878	I am miserable—ah—and bathed in miserable anguish!		
A4879	Ah this guilt can never be fastened onto any other mortal so as to remove my own!  It was I, yes, I, who killed you, I the wretch.I admit the truth.  Lead me away, my servants, lead me from here with all haste, who am no more than a dead man!		
A4880	or mortals have no release from destined misfortune.		
A4881	The great words of arrogant men have to make repayment with great blows, and in old age teach wisdom.		
A4882	how well you prove your loyalty to our house		
A4883	so that we may gladden them with the false tidings that this body of mine exists no more, but has been consumed with fire and reduced to ashes.		
A4884	bring vengeance for the murder of my father		
A4885	May the one who did that perish, if I may speak such a curse without breaking the gods' laws.		
A4886	you have come to relieve me in my troubles		
A4887	friends whose love responds to mine		
A4888	Courage, my daughter, courage		
A4889	Zeus in the skyis still mighty, and he sees and rules all.		
A4890	It is nevertheless with goodwill, like a true-hearted mother,that I dissuade you from begetting misery upon miseries		
A4891	I came, my child, mindful of your interests no less than my own		
A4892	next, in my own home I live with my father's murderers;  they rule over me and from themequally I either have or do without.		
A4893	So hardened is she that she joins with this polluter, fearing no Erinys.  No, as if laughing at her deeds, having found the day on which in the past she treacherously killed my father,she celebrates it with dance and song, and in monthly rites she sacrifices sheep to the gods who worked her deliverance. But I, as I joylessly witness it, cry out, waste away in the house and bewail the unholy feast named after my father,in solitary weeping.  For I cannot even grieve to the full extent which would please my heart, since this lady, who is in fact no lady, loudly reproaches me with such shameless taunts as these		
A4894	In such a state of affairs, then, friends, there is no room for self-restraint or for reverence.  Rather, in these dire straits there is much need to pursue a dire course.		
A4895	Will you not learn with any lapse of time to end your vain indulgence in futile anger?		
A4896	But if I am to live the life of the freeborn,those in power must be obeyed in all things.		
A4897	Nevertheless, right is on the side which you favor, not on that which I advise.		
A4898	yet, when I am doing my utmost to avenge our father,you do not work with me, but seek to deflect your sister from her deed. Does this not add cowardice to our miseries?		
A4899	But you, who tell me of your hatred, hate in word alone, while by your behavior you unite with the murderers of our father.  I, however, would never yield to them, not even ifone of them were to bring to me the gifts in which you now glory.  Let yours be the richly-spread table and superabundant lifestyle.  As for me, let my sustenance be only that I do not wound my own conscience—I do not covet such privilege as yours andneither would you, if you had self-control.		
A4900	If you will not cease from your mourning, they intendto send you where you will never look upon the sun's brilliance, but passing your life in a covered chamber beyond this land's borders you will make hymns of your calamity.		
A4901	Do not teach me to betray my friends. Chrysothemis I do not, but to bend before the strong. Electra Keep your flattery to yourself;  it is not in my character. Chrysothemis Regardless, it brings no honor to fall through senselessness.		
A4902	Chrysothemis		
A4903	I will fall, if need be, while honoring  my father.		
A4904	It is said that she saw the father of you and of me restored to the sunlight and to her company once more.  Then he took the scepter—once his own, but now carried by Aegisthus—and planted it at the hearth.  From it branched upward a flourishing limb, by which the whole land of the Mycenaeans was overshadowed.  Such was the tale that I heard told by one who was presentwhen she revealed her dream to the Sun-god		
A4905	let none of these offerings in your hands touch the tomb.  For neither divine law nor piety allows you to dedicate funeral gifts or bring libations to our father from his hateful wife.No!  To the winds with them!  Or cover them in a deep, dusty hole, where not one of them will ever come near our father's resting place.  Rather let these treasures be preserved for her below when she dies.  Were she not by nature the most audaciousof all women, she would never at all have tried to pour these ill-willed offerings to the man she killed.		
A4906	Still, sister, do yourself this service and help me, and him, too, that most beloved of all men, who rests in Hades' domain, our shared father		
A4907	I will.  In regard to a just deed, it is unreasonable for two people to argue, but reasonable to jump to action		
A4908	She, too, will come, she of many hands and many feet who lurks in her terrible ambush,the bronze-shod Erinys		
A4909	Clytaemnestra		
A4910	For this father of yours whom you constantly bewail alone of all the Greeks had the heart to sacrifice your own blood, your sister, to the gods—he, who, when sowing his seed, felt none of the pains I did when I gave birth.		
A4911	So, too, would the dead girl speak, if she could find a voice.		
A4912	Electra		
A4913	But I will demonstrate to you that you did not justly kill him.  No, the persuasion of that wicked man with whom you now sleep dragged you to it. Ask the huntress Artemis what wrong she punished when she stayed the frequent winds at Aulis;or I will tell you, since we may not learn from her.  My father, as I have heard, was once hunting in the grove of the goddess, when his footfall flushed a dappled and antlered stag;  he shot it, and chanced to make a certain boast concerning its slaughter.Angered by this, Leto's daughter detained the Greeks so that in requital for the beast's life my father should sacrifice his own daughter.  So it was that she was sacrificed, since the fleet had no other release, neither homeward nor to Troy.For that reason, under fierce constraint and with much resistance, at last he sacrificed her—but it was not for the sake of Menelaus.		
A4914	But suppose—for I will make your own plea—suppose that the motive of his deed was to benefit his brother.  Should you have killed him because of that?  Under what sort of law?See that by laying down such a law for men, you do not lay down trouble and remorse for yourself.  For, if we are to take blood for blood, you surely would be the first to die, if you were to meet with justice.		
A4915	Now be assured that I do feel shame for it, though I seem not to you.  I know that my behavior is unsuited to my age and inappropriate.  But then the enmity I get from you and yourbehavior compel me with harsh necessity to do this;  for reprehensible deeds are learned from reprehensible examples.		
A4916	Clytaemnestra Now by our mistress Artemis, you shall not escape the consequences of this audacity once Aegisthus returns. Electra You see?  You are driven to rage and, even though you grant me free speech, you have no patience to listen.		
A4917	Orestes is dead, to put it briefly.		
A4918	I said, and say again, “Orestes is dead.”		
A4919	Paedagogus		
A4920	Ah, miserable me!  Dearest Orestes, how your death has destroyed me!  For your passing has torn from my heartthe only hopes which still were mine:  that you would live to return some day as the avenger of our father, and also of me in my misery.		
A4921	I am pursued by joy, dear sister, and I disregard seemliness in order to come with speed.  I bring joyful news to relieve your former troubles and grief		
A4922	And the very moment I see it—ah me!—a familiar image rushes into my mind, and I feel that I am looking at a token of him whom I most love, Orestes.Then I lift it in my hands and make no sound of bad omen, but the tears of joy straightaway fill my eyes.		
A4923	next, you shall be called hereafter free, just as you were born, and shall find a worthy marriage.  For noble natures draw the gaze of all. Then do you not see what fair fame you will procure for yourself and for me, by obeying me?What citizen or stranger when he sees us will not greet us with praises such as these:  “Behold these two sisters, my friends!  They saved their father's house, and at a time when their foes were firmly established,they took their lives in their hands and administered bloodshed!  Worthy of love is this pair, worthy of reverence from all.  At festivals, and wherever the citizenry is assembled, let these two be honored by all men for their manly courage.”  Thus will every one speak of us,so that in life and in death our glory shall not fail.		
A4924	Your nature is a woman's, not a man's, and the strength of your hand is less than that of your adversaries.  And their fortune prospers day by day,while ours ebbs and comes to nothing.		
A4925	May I yet see you live exalted in might and wealth above your enemies by as much as you now dwell beneath their hand		
A4926	For I have found you enjoying no prosperous estate, yetfor observance of nature's highest laws you win the noblest prize by your reverence toward Zeus.		
A4927	We come bearing his scanty remains in a small urn, as you see.		
A4928	If your tears are for any of Orestes' tribulations, know that this vessel is his body's home. Electra Ah, sir, if this urn indeed contains him, then allow me,by the gods, to take it in my hands, so that I may weep and wail, not for these ashes alone, but for myself and for all our house with them!		
A4929	Ah, I grieve at the uselessness of my nursing long ago, the service that I often bestowedon you in sweet labor!  For you were never your mother's darling so much as mine, nor was any in the house your nurse but I, and by you I was ever called “sister.”  But now all this has vanished in a daywith your death.  Like a whirlwind you have swept everything away with you.		
A4930	But our evil fortune, yours and mine, has torn all that away, and has sent you back to me in this state, ash and a useless shade in place of your beloved form.		
A4931	ah, me, ah, me!  O pitiable body!  Alas, dear one sent on a most dire journey, how you have destroyed me, destroyed me indeed, my brother!		
A4932	Therefore accept me into this abode of yours—me, a nothing, into your nothingness,—so that I  may dwell with you hereafter below.  For when you were on earth, we shared equally, and now I wish to die and not to be left out of your grave,since I see that the dead are relieved of pain.		
A4933	Remember, Electra, you are the child of a mortal father, and Orestes was mortal.  Therefore do not grieve too much.  Death is a debt which all of us must pay.		
A4934	Ah, pity for your unwed, ill-fated life!		
A4935	What pity, then, for this miserable fortune!		
A4936	O frame dishonorably, godlessly wasted!		
A4937	Orestes Unfortunate girl, how seeing you stirs my pity! Electra Then know that you are the first who ever pitied me. Orestes Yes,  for I alone have come and been pained by your troubles .		
A4938	Electra Yes it is, if these are the remains of Orestes that I hold. Orestes They are not his, except inasmuch as fiction alone contrives to make them so.He gently takes the urn from her. Electra And where is that sufferer's tomb? Orestes There is none;  the living have no tomb.		
A4939	Electra The man is alive? Orestes If there is life in me. Electra What?  Are you he? Orestes Look at this signet, once our father's, and know if I speak the truth. Electra O blissful day! Orestes Blissful, I am your witness! Electra Is this your voice? Orestes Hear it from no other. Electra Do I hold you in my arms? Orestes May you hold me so always hereafter!		
A4940	Chorus We see him, daughter, and for this happy turn of fortune a tear of joy trickles from our eyes.		
A4941	You have told me of a grace higher still than the first, if a god brought you to our house;I acknowledge in it the work of the divine.		
A4942	Make sure that our mother does not discover you by your radiant face, when we two have gone into the house.  Rather, make lament, as if for the feigned disaster.  For when we succeed, thenthere will be opportunity to rejoice and exult in freedom.		
A4943	My old hatred of her has been welded to my heart, and since I have seen you, for very joy I will never cease to weep.		
A4944	How indeed could I stop when I have seen you come home on this one day  first as dead,and then in life?		
A4945	Orestes You have reported me as dead, I presume? Paedagogus Know that here you are a man numbered with the shades. Orestes Do they rejoice, then, at the news?  Or what do they say? Paedagogus I will tell when all is completed.  Meanwhile,all is favorable for us on their part, even that which is not favorable		
A4946	Is this he in whom alone out of many I once found a true ally at the time of our father's murder?		
A4947	after first adoring the shrines of my father'sgods, the keepers of these gates		
A4948	show what rewards the gods bestow on humans in return for their impiety!		
A4949	It would be well to whisper into this man's ear some few words of seeming gentleness,so that he may rush blindly upon his trial before Justice.		
A4950	Aegisthus Have they in fact reported him truly dead? Electra No, not reported only.  They have shown him. Aegisthus Then I can identify the corpse myself? Electra You can, indeed, though it is no enviable sight. Aegisthus You have indeed given me a joyful greeting, beyond your custom. Electra May joy be yours, if joy is what you find in these things.		
A4951	Undo the coverings from his eyes, so that our kinship, at least, may receive due mourning from me also. Orestes Lift the veil yourself.  It is not for me, but for you to look upon these remains and greet them kindly. Aegisthus You advise well, and I will obey you.To Electra. But you, call Clytaemnestra for me, if she is at home. Orestes She is near you;  do not look elsewhere.		
A4952	Orestes Do you not perceive how you have long been addressing the living in terms suited to the dead? Aegisthus Ah, I read the riddle!  It cannot be thatthis is not Orestes who speaks to me!		
A4953	Be sure that I will gladly give you all my help.  I would be hard-hearted indeed if I did not pity such suppliants as these.		
A4954	It is not because we rank you with the gods		
A4955	On, best of mortals, uplift our state! On, guard your fame, since now this land calls you savior on account of your former zeal.		
A4956	since if you are to rule this land just as you do now, it is better to be lord of men than of a wasteland.Neither walled town nor ship is anything, if it is empty and no men dwell within.		
A4957	my soul is in pain at once for the city, for myself, and for you.		
A4958	Thus you are not awakening me from sleep: no, be sure that I have wept many tears, wandered far and wide in my thought.		
A4959	Speak to all		
A4960	The sorrow that I bear for these is more than for my own life.		
A4961	My children, let us rise.  What we came to seek, this man promises of his own accord.		
A4962	First I call on you, daughter of Zeus, immortal Athena,and on your sister, Artemis, guardian of our earth, who sits on her glorious throne above the circle of our market-place, and on far-shooting Apollo: oh shine forth for me, my three-fold help against death!If ever before you drove a fiery pest from our borders to stop ruin rushing upon our city, come now also!		
A4963	Whoever knowsby whom Laius son of Labdacus was slain, I order him to declare all to me.  And if he is afraid, I order him to remove the danger of indictment from his path by denouncing himself: he will suffer no other punishment, but will only leave this land, unhurt.If anyone knows the assassin to be an alien, from another land, let him not keep silent.  I will reward him, and my thanks shall rest with him besides.		
A4964	And for myself I pray that if he should,with my knowledge, become a resident of my house, I may suffer the same things which I have just called down on others.		
A4965	But if he keeps silent, if anyone, through fear, seeks to screen himself or a friend from my orders,then hear what I shall do:  I charge you that no resident of this land, which I rule, give shelter to or address that murderer, whoever he is, or make him a partner in prayer or sacrifice,or give him a share of the lustral rite.  Ban him from your houses, all of you, knowing that this is the defilement, as the oracle of the Pythian god has recently shown to me.  In this wayI am an ally both to the god and to the dead man.  And I pray solemnly that the slayer, whoever he is, whether he alone is guilty or he has partners, may, in the horrible way he deserves, wear out his unblest life		
A4966	the wife who bore his children, and since, had his hope of offspring not been unsuccessful, children born of one mother would have tied us with a common bond—as it was, fate swooped upon his head—I will uphold this cause, as though it were that of my own father,and will leave no stone unturned in my search for the one who shed the blood,		
A4967	From which, great prophet, we find you to be our protector and only savior.		
A4968	I order you to abide by you own decree, and from this day forth not to speak to these men or to me: you are the accursed defiler of this land.		
A4969	I say that you are the killer of the man whose slayer you seek.		
A4970	I say that you have been living in unguessed shame with your closest kin, and do not see into what woe you have fallen.		
A4971	O wealth, and empire, and skill surpassing skill in life's keen rivalries, how great is the envy in your keeping, if for the sake of this office which the city has entrusted to me, a gift unsought,Creon the trustworthy, Creon, my old friend, has crept upon me by stealth, yearning to overthrow me, and has suborned such a scheming juggler as this, a tricky quack, who has eyes only for profit, but is blind in his art!		
A4972	But rather I, Oedipus the ignorant, stopped her, having attained the answer through my wit alone, untaught by birds.		
A4973	Though you are king, the right of reply must be considered the same for both: over that I have control.For I do not live as your slave, but as Loxias'		
A4974	What place will be harbor to your cries, what part of all Cithaeron will not ring with them soon, when you have learned the meaning of the nuptials in which, within that house, you found a fatal haven, after a voyage so fair?  And you have not guessed at a throng of other illswhich will bring you level with your true self and with your own children.		
A4975	This day will reveal your birth and bring your ruin.		
A4976	the man whom you have been seeking this long while,uttering threats and proclaiming a search into the murder of Laius, is here,		
A4977	And he will be discovered to be at once brother and father of the children with whom he consorts; son and husband of the woman who bore him;heir to his father's bed, shedder of his father's blood.		
A4978	The son of Zeus is springing upon him with fiery lightning, and with him come the dread unerring Fates		
A4979	He wanders under cover of the wild wood, among caves and rocks, fierce as a bull, wretched and forlorn on his joyless path, still seeking to separate himself from the doom revealed at the central shrine of the earth.But that doom lives forever, forever flits around him.		
A4980	truly I do not desire my full term of years, when I must bear such blame as this.  The wrong of this rumortouches me not in one point alone, but has the largest scope, if I am to be called a traitor in the city, a traitor by you and by my friends.		
A4981	Are you so boldfaced that you have come to my house, you who are manifestly the murderer of its master,the palpable thief of its crown?		
A4982	Now I, for one, have by nature no yearning to rule as a king rather than to do kingly deeds, and neither does any man I know who has a sound mind		
A4983	No mind will become false while it is wise		
A4984	It is not just to judge bad men good at random,or good men bad		
A4985	That you should never use an unproved rumor to cast a dishonoring charge on the friend who has bound himself with a curse. Oedipus		
A4986	Unhappy that I am!  I think that I havelaid myself under a terrible curse without realizing it.		
A4987	Insolence, once vainly stuffed with wealththat is not proper or good for it, when it has scaled the topmost ramparts, is hurled to a dire doom, where one's feet cannot serve to good advantage		
A4988	I will always hold the god as our protector.		
A4989	No, King—if this you are rightly called—Zeus all ruling, may it not escape you and your deathless power!  The old prophecies concerning Laius are fading; already men give them no value, and nowhere is Apollo glorified with honors;the worship of the gods is perishing.		
A4990	Because you had no blood in common with Polybus.		
A4991	It must not happen that, with such clues in my grasp, I fail to bring my birth to light. Iocasta For the gods' sake, if you have any care for your own life, do not continue this search!  My anguish is enough. Oedipus Be of good courage.  Even if I should be found the son of a servile mother—a slave by three descents—you will not be proven baseborn. Iocasta Hear me, I implore you: do not do this. Oedipus I will not hear of not discovering the whole truth. Iocasta Yet I wish you well—I counsel you for the best. Oedipus These best counsels, then, vex my patience. Iocasta Oh ill-fated man, may you never know who you are! Oedipus Go, some one, fetch me the herdsman.Leave this woman to glory in her princely stock.		
A4992	Oh, oh!  All brought to pass, all true.  Light, may I now look on you for the last time—I who have been found to be accursed in birth,accursed in wedlock, accursed in the shedding of blood		
A4993	Alas, generations of mortals, how mere a shadow I count your life!  Where, where is the mortal whoattains a happiness which is more than apparent and doomed to fall away to nothing?  Your fate warns me—yours, unhappy Oedipus—to call noearthly creature blessed.		
A4994	But now whose story is more grievous in men's ears?Who is a more wretched slave to fierce plagues and troubles, with all his life reversed?		
A4995	The old happiness of their ancestral fortune was once happiness indeed.  But now today lamentation, ruin, death, shame, and every earthly ill that anyone could name  are all theirs.		
A4996	What citizen did not gaze on his fortune with envy?  See into what a stormy sea of troubles he has come! Therefore, while our eyes wait to see the final destined day, we must call no mortal happy untilhe has crossed life's border free from pain.		
A4997	You must cheat the mind of Philoctetes by means of a storytold as you converse with him.  When he asks you who and from where you are, say that you are the son of Achilles—it is not in that detail that you will cheat him.  But tell him you are sailing homeward, and have left the fleet of the Achaean warriors, after coming to hate them with unbounded hatred.Give him this reason:  when, with no other hope of taking Ilium, they had summoned you by their prayers to come from home, they judged you not worthy of the arms of Achilles, not worthy to receive them—even though you had come and were claiming them by right—but instead handed them over to Odysseus.		
A4998	I abhor acting on advice, son of Laertes, which causes pain in the hearing.  It is not in my nature to achieve anything by means of evil cunning, nor was it, as I hear, in my father's		
A4999	And yet I was sent to assist you and am reluctant to be called traitor.  Still I prefer, my king,to fail when doing what is honorable than to be victorious in a dishonorable manner.		
A5000	Neoptolemus Then you think it brings no shame to speak what is false? Odysseus No, not if the falsehood yields deliverance. Neoptolemus And with what expression on his face will anyone dare mouth those lies? Odysseus When what you do promises gain, it is wrong to shrink back.		
A5001	For my part, I pity him when I think how,with no one to care for him, and seeing no companion's face, but suffering eternally alone, he is plagued by fierce disease and bewildered by each need as it arises.How, how does he endure his bitter fate?		
A5002	pity you		
A5003	And I myself attest your accusations,for I know their truth through my own experience with the wickedness of the Atreids and the force of Odysseus.		
A5004	He, though, lay ready for burial, and I, unhappy,when I had wept for him, went before long to the Atreids, to friends, as it was reasonable to suppose,—and claimed my father's arms and all else that had been his.  O, their reply was bold and shameless!  ‘Seed of Achilles, you may take all elsethat was your father's.  But of those arms another man now is lord, the son of Laertes.’  The tears came quick to my eyes as I sprang up in passionate anger and said in my bitterness, ‘Madman!  Have you dared give my armsto another man in my place, without asking me?’		
A5005	And where the worse man is stronger than the good, where nobility goes to ruin and the vile man dominates—among such men I will never make my friends.		
A5006	keeping in mind that all human destiny is full of the fear and the danger that prosperity may be followed by its opposite.  He who stands clear of trouble must beware of dangers,and when a man lives at ease, then it is that he must look most closely to his livelihood, lest it secretly suffer ruin.		
A5007	Only may the gods give us safe passage from this land, and from here to whatever destination we choose! Philoctetes O day of joy unsurpassed!  Most delightful man, and you good sailors!  If only I could show you in deeds what a true friend you have made in me!		
A5008	Merchant Son of Achilles, I asked my companion here, when he was guarding your ship with two others, to tell me where you might be found,since I have chanced upon you unexpectedly by the good fortune of coming to anchor off this very coast.  With no great company I am homeward bound on my trader's voyage from Ilium to Peparethus with its cluster-laden vines, but when I heard that the sailorswere all of your crew, I resolved not to continue my voyage in silence, without first giving you my news and getting the due reward.  You know nothing, I suspect, of your own affairs:  the new designs the Greekshave regarding you, and not only designs, but deeds in progress and no longer postponed.		
A5009	I truly marvel how—how in the world—as he listened in solitude to the breakers rushing around him,he kept his hold upon a life so full of grief.		
A5010	Here, he alone was his own neighbor, powerless to walk, with no one in the land to be his companion while he suffered—no one to whom he could cry out a lament that would be answeredfor the plague that gnawed his flesh and drained his blood—no one to lull with healing herbs gathered from the nourishing earth the burning blood which oozed from the ulcers of hisenvenomed foot, whenever the torment attacked him		
A5011	Ah, poor wretch!  Poor man, truly for all your sufferings!		
A5012	Shall I support you, or somehow offer a helping hand?		
A5013	My heart has long been aching for your load of pain.		
A5014	Take heart, we will remain. Philoctetes Will you? Neoptolemus Be sure of it.		
A5015	I could never have expected this, son—that you would have the patience to wait so tenderly upon my sufferings by staying close beside me and helping to relieve me.		
A5016	O Zeus, what shall I do?  Must I be twice found base—by disloyal silence, as well as by shameful speech?		
A5017	Although he swore to take me to my home, it is to Troy that he takes me.  Although he gave me his right hand in pledge of his word, he has taken my bow, the sacred bow, once belonging to Zeus's son Heracles, and he keeps it, and wants to show it to the Argives as his own.		
A5018	A startling pity for him has come upon me—and not now for the first time, but long ago.		
A5019	while I live miserably among countless sufferings, mocked by you and by the sons of Atreus, the two generals whom you serve on this errand.And yet you sailed with them only when brought under their yoke by trickery and compulsion.  But me, when, to my utter ruin, I sailed of my own accord as their mate with seven ships, me they cast out of ship and honor, as you claim, while they say that it was your doing.  And now, why would you take me?  Why have me led away?  For what purpose?I am nothing, and, as far as you were concerned, I have long been dead.		
A5020	if the gods care for justice.  But I know that they do care for it,		
A5021	O, fatherland, and you watchful gods, bring your vengeance, bring your vengeance on them all after so long, if at all you pity me!		
A5022	The boy commands our ship.  Whatever he says to you, that is our answer also.		
A5023	Doom, god-sent doom constrained you to suffer this, not, I tell you, any treachery to which my hand was lent		
A5024	Aim your hate-filled, baneful curse elsewhere, since I prefer that you not reject my friendship.		
A5025	A man must always assert what is right.  But, when he has done so, he must not let loose malignant, stinging taunts.		
A5026	a professed friend, with my destruction in his treacherous heart.		
A5027	Philoctetes What did you say?  Am I being tricked a second time? Neoptolemus No, I swear it by the pure majesty of Zeus most high! Philoctetes O welcome words—if your words are true! Neoptolemus The deed will soon make it plain.  Come, stretch out your right hand and be master of your bow!		
A5028	the army's chiefs, the lying heralds of the Greeks, though bold with words, are cowards in the fight.		
A5029	It is true that men are compelled to bear the fortunes given by the gods;		
A5030	For you, certainly, since I am your friend and speak in friendship.		
A5031	Neoptolemus What if they ravage my country? Philoctetes I will be there— Neoptolemus And what aid will you render? Philoctetes —And with the shafts of Heracles— Neoptolemus What? Philoctetes —I will keep them away. Neoptolemus Then say your farewell to this island, and leave with me.		
A5032	First I would tell you of my own fortunes—how, by toiling through and enduring so many toils to the end, I have won the glory of deathlessness, as you witness		
A5033	But of this be mindful, when you plunder the land—that you show reverence towards the gods.  Do this because Father Zeus regards all else as of less account, and because Piety does not die along with mortals.  Whether they are alive or dead, their piety does not perish.		
A5034	like twin lions with the same quarry, each of you must guard the other's life

A5073	"Oh! maiden, throw me into the well!"" The fish repeated this so often and so imploringly that at length she rose and threw the fish into the well."		
A5074	The fish repeated this so often and so imploringly that at length she rose and threw the fish into the well.		
A5075	attire yourself in the best and most elegant robe you find there, and put on a pair of gold slippers which are ready for you, as you will see, for I mean you to go to the same festival as your sisters are gone to		
A5076	"I promise you that a time is in store for you when you will be very happy indeed."""		
A5077	"""Oh, maiden! will you marry me?"		
A5078	", ""I cannot possibly marry a fish!"" but he so entreated her, and urged his suit so ardently, that she at last consented. That very instant the fish was transformed into a man"		
A5079	. The maiden, however, very respectfully signified to him that it could not be, as she was already engaged to be the bride of his majesty's son, the prince who had been spell-bound so long		
A5080	punished		
A5081	"The ""Hearth-Cat"" remained in the palace as the bride of the prince, who afterwards succeeded to the throne, and became king."		
A5082	"and then she would give the ""Hearth-Cat"" a new dress."		
A5083	"""Oh! my daughter, you will have to marry me, because your mother, before she died, expressed a wish that I should marry whoever this ring would fit."		
A5084	your mother, before she died, expressed a wish that I should marry whoever this ring would fit.		
A5085	My father says that I must marry him		
A5086	Listen to me, royal lady, go and tell your father that you will only marry him on condition that he buys you a dress of the colour of the stars in the heavens.		
A5087	Well, father, I shall marry you when you bring me a dress of the colour of the stars in the heavens.		
A5088	What can ail me! my father has bought me the dress I asked him for, and he wishes to marry me		
A5089	you must now ask him to bring you a dress of the colour of the flowers that grow in the fields.		
A5090	The princess again went to her father and told him that she could only marry him on condition of his bringing her a robe of the colour of wild flowers		
A5091	What can ail me, indeed! my father has bought me the second robe, and is determined to marry me.		
A5092	Ask your father now for a robe of various colours		
A5093	replied that the king had bought her the third robe she required of him, and was now determined that the marriage should take place		
A5094	Royal lady, you must now send for a carpenter and order him to make you a dress of wood; get inside it and go to the palace of the king who lives yonder, who requires a servant to tend the ducks.		
A5095	The princess, greatly distressed, shut herself up in a room which had the window looking into the garden, and gave vent to her grief		
A5096	The moment the princess reached it she took off everything she had on, and the wooden dress also; she washed herself, as she was travel-stained, and then put on the richest robe she had, which was the one the colour of the stars. The king was taking a walk in the garden, and noticed a lovely maiden		
A5097	"""Indeed there was no one else there but myself in disguise."""		
A5098	Now you shall remain locked up in the house.		
A5099	God, preserve me!		
A5100	divining rod, by the virtue that God gave you, send me here the best royal carriage, which is the very one that took the king to the feast		
A5101	and the princess replied by asking him to give her a pair of boots, which the king threw at her and took his departure for the feast		
A5102	The king, who had his eyes continually fixed upon her, went out to the guards and told them not to allow the maiden to pass		
A5103	The king, who had his eyes continually fixed upon her, went out to the guards and told them not to allow the maiden to pass. But when she wished to get out she threw them a bag of money, and the guards allowed her to pass		
A5104	the same one who had appeared at the feast dressed in the robe the colour of the stars in the heavens, sitting down busy with some embroidery.  When the princess left her chamber to retire to the dinner-table again disguised,		
A5105	Do not be troubled for you shall marry me!		
A5106	The princess recounted all the events of her life and the king married her.		
A5107	The king next sent for the little old woman who had given her the wand, to come and live in the palace,		
A5108	"""Why do you weep, royal lady?"""		
A5109	but I promise you that you shall not enjoy it, for I shall not allow you to go to it.		
A5110	You shall not be allowed to go there.		
A5111	she informed them that she was from the land of the towel.		
A5112	"""Oh! Maria do Pau, you must embroider a pair of shoes for me.""  She replied: ""Do I know how to embroider shoes?"" and she left the parlour to go back to her chamber."		
A5113	The old woman was blind of one eye, and the boy went on the blind side and stole a cake, because he felt so hungry.		
A5114	stole a cake, because he felt so hungry.  Believing that it was her cat which had stolen the cake		
A5115	She went on the side of the old woman's blind eye and stole another of her cakes.		
A5116	"She went on the side of the old woman's blind eye and stole another of her cakes. The old woman, again thinking that it was her cat, said, ""Be off! shoo you old pussy; these cakes are not meant for you!"""		
A5117	The children, instead of their little fingers, showed her the tail of a cat they had found inside the box		
A5118	The children, instead of their little fingers, showed her the tail of a cat they had found inside the box.		
A5119	You are gathering sticks, my children, to heat the oven, but you do not know that the old hag wants to bake you in it.		
A5120	"Sit you here, little granny, that we may first see you dance in the oven."""		
A5121	but the very moment the children saw her on the peel they thrust the peel into the oven with the witch upon it.		
A5122	The boys with their long hook, from the top of the roof, fished up the warm cakes one after the other, as the old hag placed them on the dish.		
A5123	The children took possession of the shed and all it contained.		
A5124	These brothers were consecrated to St. Peter		
A5125	No, no, old lady, you get upon it first, and one can then easily learn how it is to be done.		
A5126	Saint Peter, come to our help!		
A5127	Saint Peter came,		
A5128	pushed the old hag into the oven, stirred the fire, and shut the oven door		
A5129	Saint Peter came, pushed the old hag into the oven, stirred the fire, and shut the oven door.		
A5130	After this the boys continued to partake of the remaining cakes very comfortably.		
A5131	The children did as they were bid		
A5132	"when you reach the wood you will find me there collecting fire- wood,"" The children did as they were bid; and after the mother had gone out they went following the track of the beans which she went strewing along the road, but they did not find her in the wood or anywhere else"		
A5133	the boy went on the blind side and stole a cake, because he felt so hungry		
A5134	"the boy went on the blind side and stole a cake, because he felt so hungry.  Believing that it was her cat which had stolen the cake, she said, ""You thief of a cat! leave my cakes alone; they are not meant for you!"""		
A5135	"""Ah! is it you, my dear grandchildren? Eat, eat away, and get fat!""  She then took hold of them and thrust them into a large box full of chestnuts, and shut them up."

A5137	"The children, instead of their little fingers, showed her the tail of a cat they had found inside the box. The old hag then said: ""My pets, you can come out now, for you have grown nice and plump."""		
A5138	"""You are gathering sticks, my children, to heat the oven, but you do not know that the old hag wants to bake you in it."""		
A5139	"She further told them that the old witch meant to order them to stand on the baker's peel, saying: ""Stand on this peel, my little pets, that I may see you dance in the oven; but that they were to ask her to sit upon it herself first, that so they might learn the way to do it"

A5142	the very moment the children saw her on the peel they thrust the peel into the oven with the witch upon it. The old hag gave a great start, and was burnt to a cinder immediately after. The children took possession of the shed and all it contained.		
A5143	"The brothers said one to another, ""Let us get upon the roof."""		
A5144	They made a very long hook-stick, and got upon the roof.		
A5145	"The boys with their long hook, from the top of the roof, fished up the warm cakes one after the other, as the old hag placed them on the dish.  As the cat was by her side, and every time she placed a cake on the dish she found the other gone, she kept repeating and exclaiming:—""Shoo, you naughty thief of a pussy, how can you manage to eat so many cakes?"""		
A5146	The old hag, looking up towards the roof, startled, saw the boys, and told them to come down. The boys feared to do so, and refused to descend		
A5147	"""No, no, old lady, you get upon it first, and one can then easily learn how it is to be done."""

A5149	"""Saint Peter, come to our help!"" cried out the brothers"		
A5150	As night had come on they perceived in the darkness a light shining at a distance, easy of access		
A5151	Shortly after they had met this good lady they found the old witch in the woods		
A5152	The children replied to the witch as the good fay had instructed them		
A5153	the very moment the children saw her on the peel they thrust the peel into the oven with the witch upon it.		
A5154	which they replied that there was not; and on asking the same question of her servants they made the same answer.

A5156	"placing the princess in it ordered her servants to take her far away into the country and there to cut off her head, and to bring back her tongue.

A5157	"Your highness is not aware for what purpose we have brought you here; but we shall do you no harm."""		
A5158	They then begged of the princess to flee to some distant part and never to return to the city, so as not to betray them.		
A5159	They found a small bitch and killed her, and cut her tongue off, telling the princess that they had done this to take it to her majesty, for she had commanded them to behead her, and to take her back the tongue.		
A5160	He told her not to be ashamed; and they both afterwards dined at the table, and at night they also supped together.

A5180	the man opening a cupboard showed her a complete suit of a country-woman's clothes		
A5181	The maiden dressed herself in them and went out. When she was out walking she saw a gentleman coming towards her. The maiden immediately turned back very much alarmed, and hid herself at home		
A5182	At night when the man returned home he asked her if she had enjoyed her walk, to which she replied that she had, but this she said in a timid tone of voice.		
A5183	The next day the man again sent her out to take a walk. The maiden did so and again saw the same gentleman coming towards her, and as before she fled home in great fright to hide herself		
A5184	When the man saw her in the evening and asked her whether she had enjoyed her walk the maiden replied that she had not, because she had seen a man approach as though he wished to speak to her, and therefore she did not wish ever to go out again.

A5190	When she saw the man again in the evening she related to him all that had passed		
A5191	He told her that when the guard should return for the answer she was to tell him that the queen must come to her as she would not go to the queen.		
A5192	When the guard returned next day for the answer, the girl told him that she did not dare inform him of her decision. The guard told her to say whatever she liked, that he would repeat it to the queen. The girl then told him what the man had advised her to say.

A5195	The guard then recounted all that the girl had said. The queen was very angry, but as at that very moment the prince was attacked with a severe fit of convulsions, and the queen feared he might die of it, she resolved to go.		
A5196	as she was approaching the house it was transformed into a palace, the man who had sheltered the girl was turned into a powerful emperor, the pigs into dukes, the maiden into a beautiful princess, and all the rest into wealth and riches		
A5197	She told the maiden that seeing that her son the prince was so greatly in love with her she begged of her, if such was pleasing to her, to consent to marry the prince, as otherwise he would most certainly die		
A5198	if such was pleasing to her, to consent to marry the prince

A5465	— Avenge me on your best friend, who gave me a kiss.		
A5466	but he asks him to delay his rigor, to tell the whole court what happened		
A5467	They were all sorry that such fidelity was so badly repaid, and the prince decided to put the marble statue, which had been his best friend, in the palace garden.		
A5468	but full of confidence in the power of friendship		
A5469	when the prince turned to the place where his children were, he found them very merry and playing, with only a little red ribbon around their necks.		
A5470	The prince hesitated, but full of confidence in the power of friendship, he beheaded the children, and the statue immediately moved, and there appeared his friend alive again.		
A5471	For if you want your friend alive again (a voice said to him) kill those children of yours, and anoint this stone with innocent blood.

A5475	The cobbler's son heard all this, and when morning came he told the prince that they had better return to the kingdom, for the king must have been very bitter, and that he would give him pardon and leave to marry the maiden, who was of royal blood.		
A5476	knowing that it was the advice of the cobbler's son that made him return home, he gave him leave to live in the palace in the company of his friend.		
A5477	and asked the cobbler's son what he wanted as a gift on the wedding day.		
A5478	but the prince always consented		
A5479	As he had expected this, he unloaded a sharp blow and killed the monster,		
A5480	the boy began to relate everything, and gradually became marble		
A5481	but the cobbler's son said that those oranges could not be sold,		
A5482	as the other dove had said, but the cobbler's son said there was nothing to take the water from.		
A5483	There was once a king's son who was very friendly with a shoemaker's son		
A5484	the prince was not ashamed to accompany the shoemaker's son everywhere		
A5485	The king was not pleased with this confidence, and told the cobbler to send his son far away, giving him a lot of money

A5498	I wish my friend was alive again		
A5499	For if you want your friend alive again (a voice said to him) kill those children of yours, and anoint this stone with innocent blood		
A5500	The prince hesitated,		
A5501	They embraced each other,		
A5502	They were never parted again, and from then on they all lived very happily.		
A5503	Girl, don't pick up that rattle; it could put some dirt under your nails, and cause great pain.		
A5504	It was the girl who had fainted, unconscious.		
A5505	On top of a box was a rattle with tow, and the girl took it to amuse herself:		
A5506	Distressed by this misfortune, she hid the girl, and as soon as it was nightfall she went to bed in the royal penthouse; she put a pillow over her head and covered her with a blanket, pretending she was asleep.		
A5507	he felt in love with her,		
A5508	The prince wanted to wake her, because he knew she was not dead, and wanted to speak to her. It was all impossible		
A5509	and would return to the cave, where he kept the sleeping girl, who even so came to have three children.		
A5510	and by chance, without knowing how,		
A5511	The queen was already suspicious of her son's absences, and was trying to see if she could find out anything.		
A5512	the prince had it made on purpose		
A5513	who knew everything from the page that accompanied her son,		
A5514	The son, afraid of the queen's bad temper, said nothing		
A5515	Go now, or I'll have you killed, and bring me the boy Carnation here. Tell my daughter-in-law that the prince has told me everything.		
A5516	Eat, eat, it's yours.		
A5517	After a few days, the queen ordered the page to fetch the girl Rose. The same things followed		
A5518	he told his daughter-in-law to come to the court, because he wanted her to marry his son.		
A5519	got up to see what it was.		
A5520	He saw the queen wanting to strangle her daughter-in-law.		
A5521	It was then that the maid of the kitchen said that she had not obeyed the queen's orders, and that she had hidden the children.		
A5522	The queen was condemned, and the page sentenced to death		
A5523	The queen was condemned, and the page sentenced to death, and the maid in payment was made a lady to the new queen.		
A5524	she put a pillow over her head and covered her with a blanket		
A5525	The girl, who was already homesick, for seeing herself without her children,		
A5526	he maid of the kitchen said that she had not obeyed the queen's orders,		
A5527	Full of curiosity, the picker wanted to see what was inside		
A5528	The daughter got ready to go, and after embracing her sisters left for the Moor's palace		
A5529	the unhappy girl, full of curiosity, wanted to see what was in that room		
A5530	saw that it had a stain of blood on it.		
A5531	wished they could come back to life.		
A5532	": ""I see you well,"" so that the Moor would think that it was she who was speaking to him from the belvedere."		
A5533	; but as she was very clever, what would she remember! She made a straw doll, put on her dresses, put it on the belvedere, and got into the barrel,		
A5534	So the daughters all returned to their father's house; and the Moor returned to the palace and went to embrace the straw doll, thinking it was the girl,		
A5535	So the daughters all returned to their father's house;		
A5536	d she ran, and ran, until she reached her father's house		
A5537	after telling the Moor to go quickly, because she was going to see him from the belvedere		
A5538	fell down from the lookout, dying instantly bursting;		
A5539	So the daughters all returned to their father's house; and the Moor returned to the palace and went to embrace the straw doll, thinking it was the girl, and fell down from the lookout, dying instantly bursting;		
A5540	"""Since you have dared to penetrate my palace, I order you to bring me the first thing that appears to you when you arrive at your house, and if you do not comply you are certain to die in three days""."		
A5541	Then he, weeping, told his daughter everything that had happened to him, and asked her to go, or else the Moor would kill him, and she and her sisters would be left without shelter		
A5542	he gave her the keys to all the rooms in the palace, and put round her neck a thin gold chain with the key to a room, forbidding her to enter it, for if she went there she would die. One day when the Moor had gone out, the unhappy girl, full of curiosity, wanted to see what was in that room, she went in and saw many people with their heads cut off;		
A5543	Then, without a word, he cut off the head of the poor girl, and laid her down in the same room where she had entered.		
A5544	The sisters advised her to clean the key, so that the Moor would not know what she had done.		
A5545	The Moor returned home and suspected nothing,		
A5546	and then began to love the girl so much		
A5547	the Moor made the same recommendations to her that he had made to the other sisters. The girl went into the room of the dead and saw the beheaded sisters,		
A5548	It is the same thing that had happened to his sister. It was only the youngest daughter left to the spoon-boy, but as the Moor ordered him to take her too, he took her to him.		
A5549	It is the same thing that had happened to his sister.		
A5550	. One day she asked him to take a barrel of sugar to her father, for he was very poor;		
A5551	the palace and the chestnut tree disappeared, for everything was a work of enchantment.		
A5552	then she saw two bowls with the names of the sisters, took their heads, put them together with the bodies, and poured the blood over their necks; and soon the sisters were alive again.		
A5553	. One day she asked him to take a barrel of sugar to her father, for he was very poor; the Moor said yes.		
A5554	that he let himself be dominated by her		
A5555	forbidding her to enter it, for if she went there she would die. One day when the Moor had gone out, the unhappy girl, full of curiosity, wanted to see what was in that room		
A5556	Then, without a word, he cut off the head of the poor girl, and laid her down in the same room where she had entered		
A5557	Go and fetch your middle daughter to come and keep company with the one who is here, for she is very sad and longing for her.		
A5558	The girl went into the room of the dead and saw the beheaded sisters,		
A5559	r. The sisters advised her to clean the key, so that the Moor would not know what she had done.		
A5560	. One day she asked him to take a barrel of sugar to her father, for he was very poor; the Moor said yes		
A5561	She then put one of her sisters inside the barrel, and told the Moor to go quickly		
A5562	and she ran, and ran, until she reached her father's house		
A5563	and in the same way sent the other sister.		
A5564	; but as she was very clever		
A5565	She made a straw doll, put on her dresses, put it on the belvedere, and got into the barrel,		
A5566	the Moor returned to the palace and went to embrace the straw doll, thinking it was the girl,		
A5567	So the daughters all returned to their father's house		
A5568	went to embrace the straw doll, thinking it was the girl		
A5569	They lived very happily, because they loved each other ardently		
A5570	the two beings who adored each other		
A5571	they rendered every day to the Almighty, they fervently implored and begged Him to complete the Eden of their life		
A5572	God, certainly moved by compassion, granted them a daughter,		
A5573	As there was no more cutlery to offer her, they gave her a silver one: she was very spiteful and intimately swore to take revenge for the affront		
A5574	for all her colleagues to predict for the new-born child all the fortunes and a bright future.		
A5575	an irremediable misfortune. In the end, a prince will come to disenchant her and marry her later.		
A5576	imposing great penalties, with confiscation of goods and loss of life for all those who infringed it		
A5577	the king and the queen went out for a walk		
A5578	The princess, caring for nothing,		
A5579	only obeying the impulses of her playful genius, feeling better, went out and arrived at  the house of a septuagenarian who was spinning against the expressly forbidden order.		
A5580	the girl came to see it and was so curious		
A5581	that she found it so amusing that she would not let it go, and wanted to take it to the palace		
A5582	the girl heard nothing and heeded nothing, so that when she arrived at the palace she began to spin.		
A5583	a kindly young man,		
A5584	the happiness with which he had overcome all the dangers, all the obstacles to reach her, were evidence that he had been predestined to marry her		
A5585	They married and were very happy,		
A5586	They married and were very happy, but from time to time a dark cloud came between such happiness and it was when the princess thought of the origin of her orphanhood.		
A5587	All the staff were in an uproar because on that day there was a reception and a big gala dinner to celebrate such an auspicious day, but also one full of doubts.		
A5588	At the age of 15, when everything in the palace is getting ready to solemnise her birthday with all pomp, taking advantage of the waking absence of her parents, she will put a spindle in her right hand that will make her and all the palace staff fall asleep for a hundred years,		
A5589	the prince, very compassionate, tried to make her feel better		
A5590	with the most persuasive words, making her see that she had lost the ones who adored her so much, but that, in compensation, she had found in him an affectionate spouse who would remedy such a cruel misfortune with affection and with his love, never extinguished		
A5591	She deeply regretted the loss of her parents because of her disobedience		
A5592	the prince revealed to her the whole truth, explaining how long it had been like that		
A5593	once the spindle was taken away from her, she moved again		
A5594	that youthful face of rare, astonishing beauty!		
A5595	beautiful as love, but very restless, she would never stop and nothing would stop with her.		
A5596	In a faraway country there lived a king, married to an extremely beautiful woman		
A5597	Those present asked her to revoke such a cruel sentence, but it was inexorable. As a remedy, there was only the prohibition of not spinning in that land and its domains, and so the king issued a decree that he wisely made public, imposing great penalties, with confiscation of goods and loss of life for all those who infringed it		
A5598	married to an extremely beautiful woman		
A5599	they loved each other ardently		
A5600	very restless, she would never stop and nothing would stop with her.		
A5601	to each state their oracle		
A5602	and it goes without saying that they were religiously listened to, especially by the parents.

A5607	the young girl stayed in the palace on the pretext of a slight indisposition.		
A5608	only obeying the impulses of her playful genius,		
A5609	went out and arrived at  the house of a septuagenarian who was spinning against the expressly forbidden order		
A5610	for fear of punishment		
A5611	the girl heard nothing and heeded nothing,		
A5612	a kindly young man		
A5613	a very stout-hearted prince who feared nothing		
A5614	yet after struggling with the beasts and a thousand obstacles he managed to enter;		
A5615	she had found in him an affectionate spouse who would remedy such a cruel misfortune with affection and with his love, never extinguished		
A5616	the Lord walked through the world		
A5617	he wouldn't give the oranges to them because his father had forbidden it		
A5618	Then Saint Peter and the Lord passed by,		
A5619	go to an orange tree and eat as many as you like.		
A5620	I haven't given them to anyone, but go to an orange tree and eat as many as you like.		
A5621	I don't want them for myself		
A5622	ask him for anything you want, and he'll give you everything		
A5623	Go up to the orange trees and eat as many as you like.		
A5624	I don't want any, my boy. Now ask for whatever you want.		
A5625	Do you want salvation?  - Yes, Lord, I do,		
A5626	The Lord took a bagpipe out of his pocket and gave it to the boy		
A5627	The boy said that if they didn't eat it was because they didn't want to		
A5628	he had a little bagpipe that made them dance and they didn't eat anything.		
A5629	The reed fell down  The oven crumbled down, the boy died,  and the whole family died.		
A5630	the Lord walked through the world,		
A5631	Then Saint Peter and the Lord passed by, and Saint Peter said:		
A5632	he'll give you everything.		
A5633	but go to an orange tree and eat as many as you like.		
A5634	Now ask for whatever you want.		
A5635	The father, when he saw this, scolded the boy.		
A5636	I don't want any, my boy.		
A5637	Look, my boy, I don't want them for myself,		
A5638	Oh woman, do you want to know why the boy won't let the sheep eat?		
A5639	He said he wouldn't give the oranges to them because his father had forbidden it.		
A5640	The boy said that if they didn't eat it was because they didn't want to; that he had a little bagpipe that made them dance and they didn't eat anything.		
A5641	The boy will arrive, won't see anyone, he will put the sheep into their court and will sit down at the fire to play his bagpipe.		
A5642	she was very sorry that she was so beautiful, because everyone wanted her.		
A5643	She asked her father to give her a blue and grey dress and her father gave it to her.		
A5644	; her father did as she wished		
A5645	went from there to serve as a maid.		
A5646	she asked the magic wand to make her ugly. She put on a fur and a very ugly mask		
A5647	The inhabitants of the city gathered to make a great feast that lasted three days		
A5648	Beautiful White asked the queen for permission to go to those parties. The queen said: - Ask the king, my son, he alone governs.		
A5649	Ask the king, my son, he alone governs.		
A5650	She  went to ask the king's permission		
A5651	I'm from the land of the boot.		
A5652	I’m from the land of the cane.		
A5653	I’m from the land of the towel.		
A5654	— I order you to take off that dress		
A5655	— I order you to take off that dress. She obeyed		
A5656	the king could see the lady he loved so much		
A5657	Beautiful White told the reason for all this		
A5658	and her father gave it to her.		
A5659	She got the dress right away.		
A5660	her father did as she wished.		
A5661	she stayed as a maid.		
A5662	he alone governs.		
A5663	My magic wand, get me a car and everything I need to go to the party.		
A5664	— Where are you from?		
A5665	— I'm from the land of the boot		
A5666	Oh what a pretty face I see in the palace window!		
A5667	Where are you from?		
A5668	the lady he loved so much on the day of the feast.		
A5669	I order you to take off that dress. She obeyed,		
A5670	she went again to ask leave of the king,		
A5671	she went to ask permission to go to the party		
A5672	he was very sorry that she was so beautiful, because everyone wanted her.		
A5673	the king's disease,		
A5674	- Take these cakes to your grandmother.		
A5675	she did as her mother told her.		
A5676	a wolf, who asked her how she was doing and if her grandmother was better		
A5677	she asked him, as he was a doctor, to prescribe her some herbs that were around there.		
A5678	She did so immediately and picked them and took them to her grandmother's house.		
A5679	He dressed himself in the same dresses as the old woman		
A5680	it looks like you have big ears today?		
A5681	It's so that I can hear you better.		
A5682	And why do you have such big eyes?		
A5683	It's to see you better, my child.		
A5684	I'll go and see if she wants anything.		
A5685	in their place he put two large stones and baked the wolf's belly with a large needle.		
A5686	he fell into the water and drowned.		
A5687	They ate the cakes.		
A5688	Take these cakes to your grandmother.		
A5689	a wolf, who asked her how she was doing and if her grandmother was better; and she answered that she was well and that her grandmother was still sick		
A5690	to prescribe her some herbs that were around there. He soon pointed out some herbs (the most poisonous ones there were in the field) and told her to pick them.		
A5691	As soon as the wolf got to the old woman's house he took the key out of the hole and opened the door, reached the old woman's bed and swallowed it		
A5692	it looks like you have big ears today? - It's so that I can hear you better. - And why do you have such big eyes? - It's to see you better, my child.		
A5693	Hearing this, he said to himself: - Maybe the old woman is worse		
A5694	I'll go and see if she wants anything		
A5695	in their place he put two large stones and baked the wolf's belly with a large needle. They ate the cakes.		
A5696	The two of them lived as if they were real brothers, and had sworn to always stand by each other		
A5697	Pedro was about to leave for a foreign kingdom to marry a very beautiful princess		
A5698	had sworn to always stand by each other in the works that fortune would destine them		
A5699	Pedrito was to accompany him		
A5700	he hurried on his way with the intention of going to warn the prince, not fearing, to save the princess, to turn to stone		
A5701	to save the princess		
A5702	The princess shall pass over a bridge; she shall pass and the bridge will fall		
A5703	will ask for water, and if she is given it and drinks it, she will die		
A5704	The princess will feel sleepy on the way and will ask to rest; but while she sleeps she will be bitten by a serpent and will die right there		
A5705	, he tried to warn Prince Pedro of the great misfortunes that awaited the princess		
A5706	Pedro's pain was so great that he immediately sent for many fairies and some wise men so that they told him the way to turn Pedrito into what he was		
A5707	Pedro's pain was so great		
A5708	Pedro cut off a finger to save his brother,		
A5709	As soon as Pedrito saw this, he went to a certain sorceress so that she could help him in such an affliction		
A5710	his prize was to marry a princess		
A5711	he tried to warn Prince Pedro of the great misfortunes that awaited the princess;		
A5712	Pedrito was telling what he had heard on the way, he was turning into a stone statue.		
A5713	his prize was to marry a princess, Pedro's sister,		
A5714	they were very happy..		
A5715	"Whoever hears and tells this Shall turn to stone""."		
A5716	had sworn to always stand by each other		
A5717	a prince called Pedro who had a breastfeeding sibling called Pedrito.		
A5718	not fearing, to save the princess, to turn to stone		
A5719	not fearing, to save the princess, to turn to stone.		
A5720	"Whoever hears and tells this Shall turn to stone"".»"		
A5721	but at the same time that Pedrito was becoming a man Pedro was becoming a statue.		
A5722	at the same time that Pedrito was becoming a man Pedro was becoming a statue.		
A5723	take its blood and pour it over the statue of Peter and he will come back to life.»		
A5724	but as he wished to go more by land than by sea,		
A5725	he hurried on his way with the intention of going to warn the prince,		
A5726	he hurried on his way with the intention of going to warn the prince, not fearing, to save the princess, to turn to stone.		
A5727	she could help him in such an affliction.		
A5728	kill it by the neck, take its blood and pour it over the statue of Peter and he will come back to life.»		
A5729	Pedrito did everything as he should		
A5730	a prince called Pedro who had a breastfeeding sibling called Pedrito		
A5731	And at this they came down and beat the messenger, who died.		
A5732	THE ONE WHO GOD HELPS IS WORTH  MORE THAN THE EARLY RISER		
A5733	The king had promised to give the princess to whoever cured her		
A5734	The king did so.		
A5735	then the devils came up and said to one another:		
A5736	and the owner would give four crusades in silver to whoever would draw the water out.		
A5737	the snake that she has would come out right away,		
A5738	"""He who rises early""."		
A5739	who was watching		
A5740	, no one told him that the one who God helps  is better off.		
A5741	THE ONE WHO GOD HELPS		
A5742	"""Which is worth more, the one who God helps or the early riser"		
A5743	the one who God helps		
A5744	he who  God helps		
A5745	no one told him that the one who God helps  is better off		
A5746	the one who God helps  is better off		
A5747	there's a little light shining so far away; I'm going to stay there under that house		
A5748	if you took a basin of milk and turned the princess upside down with her mouth in the basin, the snake that she has would come out right away, which is bad for her		
A5749	who was watchin		
A5750	He received the four crusades		
A5751	if he wanted to marry her or if he wanted half of the king's income and a horse to ride		
A5752	The king did so		
A5753	per obbedire con ogni maggior prontezza		
A5754	spiegate da me con istorica purità, e con intera fedeltà registrate		
A5755	finalmente da varie confermazioni e riscontri che le autenticano per verissime e prive d’ogni eccezzione.		
A5756	Cominciò questi ne' prim'anni della sua fanciullezza a dar saggio della vivacità del suo ingegno, poiché nell'ore di spasso esercitavasi per lo più in fabbricarsi di propria mano varii strumenti e machinette, con imitare e porre in piccol modello ciò che vedeva d'artifizioso, come di molini, galere, et anco d'ogni altra macchina ben volgare. In difetto di qualche parte necessaria ad alcuno de' suoi fanciulleschi artifizii suppliva con l'invenzione, servendosi di stecche di balena in vece di molli di ferro, o d'altro in altra parte, secondo gli suggeriva il bisogno, adattando alla macchina nuovi pensieri e scherzi di moti, purché non restasse imperfetta e che vedesse operarla.		
A5757	In difetto di qualche parte necessaria ad alcuno de' suoi fanciulleschi artifizii suppliva con l'invenzione,		
A5758	il giovane, conoscendo la tenuità del suo stato e volendosi pur sollevare, si propose di supplire alla povertà della sua sorte con la propria assiduità nelli studii; che perciò datosi alla lettura delli autori latini di prima classe, giunse da per sé stesso a quell'erudizione nelle lettere umane, della quale si mostrò poi in ogni privato congresso, ne' circoli e nell'accademie, riccamente adornato, valendosene mirabilmente con ogni qualità di persona, in qualunque materia, morale o scientifica, seria o faceta, che fosse proposta.		
A5759	il Galileo, che dalla natura fu eletto per disvelare al mondo parte di que’ segreti che già per tanti secoli restavano sepolti in una densissima oscurità delle menti umane, fatte schiave del parere e de gl'asserti d'un solo, non poté mai, secondo 'l consueto degl'altri, darsele in preda così alla cieca, come che, essendo egli d'ingegno libero, non gli pareva di dover così facilmente assentire a' soli detti et opinioni delli antichi o moderni scrittori, mentre potevasi col discorso e con sensate esperienze appagar sé medesimo.		
A5760	il Galileo, che dalla natura fu eletto per disvelare al mondo parte di que’ segreti che già per tanti secoli restavano sepolti in una densissima oscurità delle menti umane,		
A5761	non poté mai, secondo 'l consueto degl'altri, darsele in preda così alla cieca, come che, essendo egli d'ingegno libero, non gli pareva di dover così facilmente assentire a' soli detti et opinioni delli antichi o moderni scrittori, mentre potevasi col discorso e con sensate esperienze appagar sé medesimo.		
A5762	E perciò nelle dispute di conclusioni naturali fu sempre contrario alli più acerrimi difensori d'ogni detto Aristotelico,		
A5763	in premio delle scoperte verità provocandosi l'odio loro; non potendo soffrire che da un giovanetto studente, e che per ancora, secondo un lor detto volgare, non avea fatto il corso delle scienze, quelle dottrine da lor imbevute, si può dir, con il latte gl'avesser ad esser con nuovi modi e con tanta evidenza rigettate e convinte:		
A5764	In questo mentre con la sagacità del suo ingegno inventò quella semplicissima e regolata misura del tempo per mezzo del pendulo,		
A5765	e facendone esperienze esattissime, si accertò dell'egualità delle sue vibrazioni,		
A5766	allora sovvennegli di adattarla all'uso della medicina per la misura della frequenza de' polsi, con stupore e diletto de' medici di que' tempi		
A5767	della quale invenzione si valse poi in varie esperienze e misure di tempi e moti, e fu il primo che l'applicasse alle osservazioni celesti, con incredibile acquisto nell'astronomia e geografia.		
A5768	Di qui s'accorse che gl'effetti della natura, quantunque apparischin minimi et in niun conto osservabili, non devon mai dal filosofo disprezzarsi, ma tutti egualmente e grandemente stimarsi; essendo perciò solito dire che la natura operava molto col poco, e che le sue operazioni eran tutte in pari grado maravigliose.		
A5769	Cominciò dunque il Ricci ad introdurre il Galileo (che già aveva compliti diciannove anni) nelle solite esplicazioni delle definizioni, assiomi e postulati del primo libro delli Elementi; ma questi sentendo preporsi principii tanto chiari et indubitati, e considerando le domande d'Euclide così oneste e concedibili, fece immediatamente concetto che se la fabbrica della geometria veniva alzata sopra tali fondamenti, non poteva esser che fortissima e stabilissima. Ma non sì tosto gustò la maniera del dimostrare, e vedde aperta l'unica strada di pervenire alla cognizione del vero, che si pentì di non essersi molto prima incamminato per quella.		
A5770	Finalmente sentendosi traportar dal diletto et acquisto che parevagli d'aver conseguito in poco tempo da tale studio, nel ben discorrere argumentare e concludere,		
A5771	assai più che dalle logiche e filosofie di tutto il tempo passato,		
A5772	sovvennegli un nuovo modo esattissimo di poter scoprire il furto di quell'orefice nella corona d'oro di Hierone : et allora scrisse la fabbrica et uso di quella sua bilancetta, per la quale s'ha cognizione delle gravità in specie di diverse materie e della mistione o lega de' metalli,		
A5773	la fabbrica et uso di quella sua bilancetta, per la quale s'ha cognizione delle gravità in specie di diverse materie e della mistione o lega de' metalli,		
A5774	Con questi et altri suoi ingegnosi trovati,		
A5775	con la sua libera maniera di filosofare e discorrere,		
A5776	inventò quello ch'in tal materia si vede scritto nell'Appendice impressa alla fine de' suoi Dialoghi delle due Nuove Scienze della meccanica e del moto locale, con gran satisfazione e maraviglia del medesimo Sig.r Guidubaldo, il quale per così acute invenzioni l'esaltò a segno appresso il Ser.mo Gran Duca Ferdinando Primo e l'Eccel.mo Principe Don Giovanni de' Medici, ch'in breve divenne a loro gratissimo e familiare:		
A5777	allora, con gran sconcerto di tutti i filosofi, furono da esso convinte di falsità, per mezzo d'esperienze e con salde dimostrazioni e discorsi, moltissime conclusioni dell'istesso Aristotele intorno alla materia del moto, sin a quel tempo state tenute per chiarissime et indubitabili;		
A5778	per mezzo d'esperienze		
A5779	furono da esso convinte di falsità, per mezzo d'esperienze e con salde dimostrazioni e discorsi, moltissime conclusioni dell'istesso Aristotele		
A5780	dimostrando ciò con replicate esperienze, fatte dall'altezza del Campanile di Pisa con l'intervento delli altri lettori e filosofi e di tutta la scolaresca;		
A5781	molti filosofastri suoi emuli, fomentati da invidia, se gli eccitarono contro;		
A5782	giudizio dato da esso sopra una tal macchina, d'invenzione d'un eminente soggetto, proposta per votar la darsina di Livorno, alla quale il Galileo con fondamenti meccanici e con libertà filosofica aveva fatto pronostico di mal evento (come in effetto seguì),		
A5783	con fondamenti meccanici		
A5784	con libertà filosofica		
A5785	nel qual tempo inventò varie macchine in servizio della medesima Republica, con suo grandissimo onore et utile insieme, come dimostrano gl'amplissimi privilegi ottenuti da quella;		
A5786	essendo di esse tanto liberale donatore quanto fecondo compositore.		
A5787	In questi medesimi tempi ritrovò i termometri, cioè quelli strumenti di vetro, con acqua et aria, per distinguer le mutazioni di caldo e freddo e la varietà de' temperamenti de' luoghi;		
A5788	Circa l'anno 1597 inventò il suo mirabile compasso geometrico e militare,		
A5789	insegnarne l'uso in voce et in scritto a' suoi discepoli, esplicandolo a molti principi e gran signori di diverse nazioni, tra' quali furono l'Ill.mo et Eccel.mo Sig.r Gio. Federigo Principe d'Olsazia, et appresso il Ser.mo Arciduca D. Ferdinando d'Austria, dopo l'Ill.mo et Eccel.mo Sig.r Filippo Langravio d'Assia, Conte di Nidda, et il Ser.mo di Mantova, et altri infiniti, che lungo sarebbe il registrargli qui tutti.		
A5790	intese provare che la nuova stella era fuori della regione elementare et in luogo altissimo sopra tutti i pianeti, contro l'opinione della scuola peripatetica e principalmente del filosofo Cremonino, che allora procurava di sostenere il contrario e di mantenere il cielo del suo Aristotele inalterabile et esente da qualunque accidentaria mutazione.		
A5791	intese provare che la nuova stella era fuori della regione elementare et in luogo altissimo sopra tutti i pianeti,		
A5792	In questi medesimi tempi fece studio et osservazione particolare sopra la virtù della calamita		
A5793	trovò modo sicuro di armarne qualunque pezzo, che sostenesse di ferro ottanta e cento volte più che disarmato;		
A5794	Nel 1607 trovandosi il Galileo fieramente offeso e provocato da un certo Baldassar Capra milanese, che si era allora temerariamente appropriata l'invenzione del suddetto compasso col tradurlo in latino e stamparlo nell'istessa città di Padova in faccia del medesimo autore, con titolo di Usus et fabrica circini cuiusdam proportionis, fu questi necessitato a publicare una sua Difesa in volgare, per evidente dimostrazione di furto così detestabile e vergognoso; difendendosi insieme dalle calunnie et imposture del medesimo Capra,		
A5795	il quale in una sua Considerazione astronomica circa la stella nuova del 1604, stampata già più di due anni avanti, l'aveva acerbamente lacerato, mosso da invidia per l'universale applauso che avevano ricevuto le tre suddette lezzioni del Galileo,		
A5796	il Capra per mezzo di queste sue abominevoli azzioni ne riportò il dovuto premio d'una perpetua ignominia,		
A5797	Non fu già valevole tal Difesa a reprimere l'audacia o la troppa confidenza di alcuni altri d'altre nazioni, i quali, allettati o traportati dalla novità e vaghezza dell'invenzione o dalla mirabil copia e facilità de' suoi usi, non esponessero alle stampe, come interamente lor proprio, questo ingegnoso compasso del Galileo, publicandolo, o con diverse inscrizioni in altra forma ridotto o con nuove linee et ad altri usi ampliato, senza pur far menzione del principale autore di tal strumento;		
A5798	Con questa sola relazione, tornando subito il Sig.r Galileo a Padova, si pose a specularne la fabbrica, quale immediatamente ritrovò la seguente notte: poiché il giorno appresso, componendo lo strumento nel modo che se lo aveva immaginato, non ostante l'imperfezione de' vetri che poté avere, ne vidde l'effetto desiderato,		
A5799	sopra le maggiori altezze della città fece vedere et osservare gl'oggetti in varie lontananze a' primi Senatori di quella Republica, con lor infinita maraviglia; e riducendo lo strumento continuamente a maggior perfezione, si risolse finalmente, con la solita prodigalità nel comunicare le sue invenzioni, di far libero dono di questa ancora al Ser.mo Principe o Doge Leonardo Donati et insieme a tutto 'l Senato Veneto, presentando con lo strumento una scrittura nella quale ei dichiarava la fabbrica, gl'usi e le maravigliose conseguenze che in terra e in mare da quello trar si potevano.		
A5800	sopra le maggiori altezze della città fece vedere et osservare gl'oggetti in varie lontananze a' primi Senatori di quella Republica, con lor infinita maraviglia;		
A5801	si risolse finalmente, con la solita prodigalità nel comunicare le sue invenzioni, di far libero dono di questa ancora al Ser.mo Principe o Doge Leonardo Donati et insieme a tutto 'l Senato Veneto,		
A5802	presentando con lo strumento una scrittura nella quale ei dichiarava la fabbrica, gl'usi e le maravigliose conseguenze che in terra e in mare da quello trar si potevano.		
A5803	In gradimento di così nobil regalo fu immediatamente, con generosa dimostrazione della Ser.ma Republica, ne' 25 d'Agosto del 1609 ricondotto il Sig.r Galileo a vita sua alla medesima lettura, con più che triplicato stipendio del maggiore che fusse solito assegnarsi a' lettori di matematica.		
A5804	pensò ancora al modo di perfezionar assai più la nostra vista con fargli perfettamente discernere quelle minuzie le quali, benché situate in qualunque breve distanza dall'occhio, gli si rendono impercettibili; et allora inventò i microscopii d'un convesso e di un concavo, et insieme d'uno e di più convessi, applicandogli a scrupolosa osservazione de' minimi componenti delle materie e della mirabile struttura delle parti e membra delli insetti,		
A5805	conseguitala a gran segno, lasciando di rimirar gl'oggetti terreni, si rivolse a contemplazioni più nobili.		
A5806	E prima, riguardando il corpo lunare, lo scoperse di superficie ineguale, ripieno di cavità e prominenze a guisa della terra. Trovò che la Via Lattea e le nebulose altro non erano ch'una congerie di stelle fisse, che per la loro immensa distanza, o per la lor piccolezza rispetto all'altre, si rendevano impercettibili alla nuda e semplice vista. Vidde sparse per lo cielo altre innumerabili stelle fisse, state incognite all'antichità: e rivolgendosi a Giove con altro migliore strumento, ch'egli s'era nuovamente preparato, l'osservò corteggiato da quattro stelle, che gli s'aggirano intorno per orbi determinati e distinti, con regolati periodi ne' lor moti; e consecrandogli all'immortalità della Ser.ma Casa di V. A., gli diede nome di Stelle o Pianeti Medicei: e tutto questo scoperse in pochi giorni del mese di Gennaio del 1610 secondo lo stile romano, continuando tali osservazioni per tutto 'l Febbraio susseguente; quali tutte manifestò poi al mondo per mezzo del suo Nuncio Sidereo,		
A5807	diedero gran materia di discorsi a' filosofi et astronomi di que' tempi, molti de' quali su 'l principio ebbero gran repugnanza in prestargli fede, e molti temerariamente si sollevarono, altri con scritture private et altri più incauti sin con le stampe , stimando quelle vanità e delirii o finti avvisi del Sig.r Galileo, o pure false apparenze et illusioni de' cristalli; ma in breve gl'uni e gl'altri necessariamente cedettero alle confermazioni de' più savii, all'esperienze et al senso medesimo.		
A5808	alle confermazioni de' più savii,		
A5809	all'esperienze et al senso medesimo.		
A5810	Non mancarono già de' così pervicaci et ostinati, e fra questi de' constituiti in grado di publici lettori , tenuti per altro in gran stima, i quali, temendo di commetter sacrilegio contro la deità del loro Aristotele, non vollero cimentarsi all'osservazioni, né pur una volta accostar l'occhio al telescopio; e vivendo in questa lor bestialissima ostinazione, vollero, più tosto che al lor maestro, usar infedeltà alla natura medesima.		
A5811	dandone avviso ad alcuni matematici di Italia e di Germania et a' suoi amici più cari per mezzo di cifre e caratteri trasposti, che doppo ordinati dal medesimo Sig.r Galileo, a richiesta dell'Imperatore Ridolfo Secondo, dicevano:  Altissimum Planetam tergeminum observavi.		
A5812	Vidde ancora nella faccia del sole alcuna delle macchie, ma per allora non volle publicare quest'altra novità, che poteva tanto più concitargli l'invidia o persecuzione di molti ostinati Peripatetici (conferendola solo ad alcuno de' suoi più confidenti di Padova e di Venezia e di altrove) , per prima assicurarsene con replicate osservazioni, e poter intanto formar concetto della essenza loro e con qualche probabilità almeno pronunciarne la sua oppinione.		
A5813	per prima assicurarsene con replicate osservazioni, e poter intanto formar concetto della essenza loro e con qualche probabilità almeno pronunciarne la sua oppinione.		
A5814	assicurarsene con replicate osservazioni		
A5815	formar concetto della essenza loro e con qualche probabilità almeno pronunciarne la sua oppinione.		
A5816	L'avviso di tante e non più udite maraviglie, scoperte in cielo dal Sig.r Galileo nella città di Padova, eccitò nelli animi d'ogni nazione veementissimo desiderio di accertarsene col senso stesso.		
A5817	nel Ser.mo D. Cosimo de' Medici non cedé punto a questa comune curiosità la sua regia munificenza, poi che volle con propria lettera de' 10 Luglio 1610 richiamarlo di Padova al suo servizio con titolo di Primario e Sopraordinario Matematico dello Studio di Pisa, senz'obligo di leggervi o risedervi, e di Primario Filosofo e Matematico della sua Ser.ma Altezza, assegnandogli a vita amplissimo stipendio, proporzionato alla somma generosità di un tanto Principe.		
A5818	nel continuare l'osservazioni che fin d'Ottobre aveva cominciate intorno alla stella di Venere, che parevagli andare crescendo in mole, l'osservò finalmente mutar figure come la luna, propalando quest'altra ammirabile novità tra gl'astronomi e matematici d'Europa con tal anagramma:  Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur o, y;		
A5819	Intorno alla fine di Marzo del 1611, desiderato il Sig.r Galileo et aspettato da tutta Roma, quivi si condusse, e nell'Aprile susseguente fece vedere i nuovi spettacoli del cielo a molti SS. Prelati e Cardinali, e particolarmente nel Giardino Quirinale, presente il Sig.r Card.le Bandini et i Mons.ri Dini, Corsini, Cavalcanti, Strozzi, Agucchia, et altri Signori, dimostrò le macchie solari:		
A5820	Avendo dunque egli solo veduto il primo nel cielo tante e così gran maraviglie, state occulte all'antichità, era ben dovere ch'egli in avvenire con nome di Linceo dovesse chiamarsi; onde allora fu quivi ascritto nella famosissima Accademia de' Lincei, poco avanti instituita dal Sig.r Principe Federigo Cesi, Marchese di Monticelli.		
A5821	Sopragiungendo l'estate, se ne tornò a Firenze, dove ne' varii congressi de' letterati, che frequentemente si facevano d'avanti al Ser.mo G. Duca Cosimo, fu una volta introdotto discorso sopra il galleggiar in acqua et il sommergersi de' corpi, e tenuto da alcuni che la figura fosse a parte di questo effetto, ma dal Sig.r Galileo sostenuto il contrario; ond'egli, per commessione della medesima Altezza, scrisse quell'erudito Discorso sopra le cose che stanno in acqua e che in quella si muovono, dedicato al suddetto Serenissimo e stampato in Firenze nell'Agosto del 1612:		
A5822	In occasione delle dispute che nacquero in proposito del galleggiare, soleva dire il Sig.r Galileo, non vi esser più sottile né più industriosa maestra dell'ignoranza, poiché per mezzo di quella gl'era sortito di ritrovare molte ingegnose conclusioni e con nuove et esatte esperienze confermarle per satisfare all'ignoranza delli avversarii, alle quali per appagare il proprio intelletto non si sarebbe applicato.		
A5823	Contro la dottrina di tal Discorso si sollevò tutta la turba peripatetica,		
A5824	quivi fece scrupolosissime osservazioni intorno alle macchie solari:		
A5825	avendo ricevuto lettera dal Sig.r Marco Velsero, Duumviro d'Augusta, accompagnata con tre del suddetto Apelle sopra l'istesso argumento, ne i 4 di Maggio del 1612 rispose a quella con varie considerazioni sopra le lettere del medesimo Apelle, replicando ancora con altra de' 14 d'Agosto susseguente; e ricevendo dal Sig.r Velsero altre speculazioni e discorsi d'Apelle, scrisse la terza lettera del primo di Dicembre prossimo, sempre confermandosi con nuove e più accurate ragioni ne' suoi concetti: e di qui nacque l' Istoria e Demostrazioni delle Macchie Solari e loro accidenti,		
A5826	non prima investigò ne' Pianeti Medicei alcuni lor varii accidenti, che pensò di valersene ancora per universal benefizio delli uomini nella nautica e geografia, sciogliendo perciò quell'ammirando problema per il quale in tutte l'età passate si sono in vano affaticati gl'astronomi e matematici di maggior fama, che è di poter in ogn'ora della notte, in qualunque luogo di mare o terra, graduare le longitudini.		
A5827	al conseguimento di ciò si richiedeva un'esatta cognizione de' periodi e moti di quelle stelle,		
A5828	quella non si poteva ottenere se non dal tempo, con moltissime e puntuali osservazioni:		
A5829	quantunque in meno di quindici mesi dal primo discoprimento de' Pianeti Medicei arrivasse ad investigare i lor movimenti con notabile aggiustatezza per le future predizioni, volle però con altre più esquisite osservazioni, e più distanti di tempo, emendargli.		
A5830	conferì il tutto al Ser.mo G. Duca Cosimo, suo Signore: il quale, molto ben conoscendo la grandezza del problema e la massima utilità che dall'uso di esso poteva trarsi, volle egli stesso, per mezzo del proprio residente in Madrid, muoverne trattato con la Maestà Cattolica del Re di Spagna, il quale già prometteva grandissimi onori e grossissime recognizioni a chi avesse trovato modo sicuro di navigar per la longitudine con l'istessa o simil facilità che si cammina per latitudine.		
A5831	per facilitare i mezzi per condurla a buon fine, conferisse a S. Maestà un altro suo nuovo trovato, pur di grandissimo uso et acquisto nella navigazione, da S. A. stimatissimo e custodito con segretezza; et era l'invenzione d'un altro differente occhiale, col quale potevasi dalla cima dell'albero o del calcese d'una galera riconoscer da lontano la qualità, numero e forze de' vasselli nemici, assai prima dell'inimico medesimo, con egual prestezza e facilità che con l'occhio libero, guardandosi in un tempo stesso con amendue gl'occhi, e potendosi di più aver notizia della loro lontananza dalla propria galera, et in modo occultar lo strumento sì che altri non ne apprenda la fabbrica.		
A5832	il suddetto Matematico, offendendosi fuor del dovere e contro l'obligo di filosofo che le sue proposizioni non fossero ammesse senz'altro esame per infallibili e vere		
A5833	pure anche invidiando alla novità de' concetti così dottamente spiegati nel sopradetto Discorso delle Comete,		
A5834	Ben è vero, all'incontro, che le calunnie e contradizioni de' suoi nemici et oppositori, che poi lo tennero quasi sempre angustiato, lo resero ancora assai ritenuto nel perfezionare e dar fuori l'opere sue principali di più maravigliosa dottrina.		
A5835	Ma essendosi già il Sig.r Galileo per l'altre sue ammirabili speculazioni con immortal fama sin al cielo inalzato, e con tante novità acquistatosi tra gl'uomini del divino, permesse l'Eterna Providenza ch'ei dimostrasse l'umanità sua con l'errare, mentre nella discussione de' due sistemi si dimostrò più aderente all'ipotesi Copernicana, già dannata da S. Chiesa come repugnante alla Divina Scrittura.		
A5836	Fu perciò il Sig.r Galileo, dopo la publicazione de' suoi Dialogi, chiamato a Roma dalla Congregazione del S. Offizio: dove giunto intorno alli 10 di Febbraio 1632 ab Incarnatione, dalla somma clemenza di quel Tribunale e del Sovrano Pontefice Urbano Ottavo, che già per altro lo conosceva troppo benemerito alla republica de' letterati, fu arrestato nel delizioso palazzo della Trinità de' Monti appresso l'ambasciador di Toscana, et in breve (essendogli dimostrato il suo errore) retrattò, come vero catolico, questa sua opinione; ma in pena gli fu proibito il suo Dialogo,

A5838	quivi ripigliando i suoi studii trovò e dimostrò gran parte delle conclusioni meccaniche sopra la materia delle resistenze de' solidi,		
A5839	nel qual Discorso intese il Galileo avvertire, quanto fosse pericoloso il valersi de' luoghi della Sacra Scrittura per l'esplicazione di quelli effetti et conclusioni naturali che poi si possino convincer di falsità con sensate esperienze o con necessarie dimostrazioni.		
A5840	restò il Sig.r Galileo grandemente mortificato, prevedendo l'impossibilità di mai più supprimergli, con molti altri ch'egli diceva trovarsi già sparsi per l'Italia e fuori manuscritti, attenenti pure all'istessa materia, fatti da lui in varie occasioni nel corso di quel tempo in che era vissuto nell'opinione d'Aristarco e del Copernico; la quale ultimamente, per l'autorità della romana censura, egli aveva catolicamente abbandonata.		
A5841	Che perciò nel 1636 si risolse di far libera offerta alli Ill.mi et Potentissimi Stati Generali delle Provincie Unite d'Olanda del suo ammirabil trovato per l'uso delle longitudini,		
A5842	Fu dalli Stati avidamente abbracciata sì generosa offerta, e nel progresso del trattato fu gradita con lor umanissima lettera, accompagnata con superba collana d'oro,		
A5843	della quale il Sig.r Galileo non volle per allora adornarsi, supplicando gli Stati a compiacersi che il lor regalo si trattenesse in altre mani sin che l'intrapreso negozio fosse ridotto a suo fine, per non dar materia a' maligni suoi emuli di spacciarlo come espilator de' tesori di gran Signori per mezzo di vane oblazioni e presuntuosi concetti.		
A5844	volle con varii accidenti impedire l'esecuzione dell'impresa, differendola ad altri tempi, con reprimer intanto il fastoso orgoglio degli uomini,		
A5845	Aveva già il Sig.r Galileo risoluto di mai più esporre alle stampe alcuna delle sue fatiche, per non provocarsi di nuovo quelli emuli che per sua mala sorte in tutte l'altre opere sue egli aveva sperimentati		
A5846	per dimostrar gratitudine alla natura, voleva comunicar manuscritte quelle che gli restavano a varii personaggi a lui ben affetti et intelligenti delle materie in esse trattate.		
A5847	Poco dopo questa inaspettata pubblicazione, concedendomisi l'ingresso nella villa d'Arcetri, dove allor dimorava il sig.r Galileo, acciò quivi io potesse godere de' sapientissimi suoi colloquii e preziosi ammaestramenti, e contentandosi questi che nello studio delle matematiche, alle quali poco avanti mi ero applicato, io ricorresse alla viva sua voce per la soluzione di quei dubbii e difficoltà che per natural fiacchezza del mio ingegno bene spesso incontravo, accadde che nella lettura de' Dialogi sopradetti, arrivando al trattato de' moti locali, dubitai, come pur ad altri era occorso, non già della verità del principio sopra 'l quale è fondata l'intera scienza del moto accelerato, ma della necessità di supporlo come noto; onde io, ricercandolo di più evidenti confermazioni di quel supposto, fui cagione ch'egli nelle vigilie della notte, che allora con gran discapito della vita gli erano familiarissime, ne ritrovò la dimostrazione geometrica, dependente da dottrina da esso pur dimostrata contro ad una conclusione di Pappo (qual si vede nel suo trattato di Meccaniche, stampato dal suddetto P. Mersennio), et a me subito la conferì, sì come ad altri suoi amici ch'eran soliti visitarlo: et alcuni mesi dopo, compiacendosi di tenermi poi di continuo appresso la sua disciplina, per guidarmi, benché cieco come egli era di corpo, d'intelletto però lucidissimo, per il sentiero di quelli studii ch'egli intendeva ch'io proseguisse, imposemi ch'io facesse il disteso di quel teorema, per la difficoltà che gli arrecava la sua cecità nell'esplicarsi dove occorreva usar figure e caratteri; e di questo ne mandò più copie per l'Italia et in Francia alli amici suoi. Per una simil occasione di dubitare mi aveva ancora esplicato una sua considerazione o dimostrazione sopra la 5a e 7a definizione del quinto libro d'Euclide, dettandola a me dopo in dialogo per inserirla in detto suo libro appresso la prima proposizione del moto equabile, quando si fosse ristampato; et è quell'istessa dimostrazione che, a richiesta di V. A. S., fu poi distesa dal Sig.rEvangelista Torricelli, che l'aveva sentita dal medesimo Sig.r Galileo.		
A5848	portando insieme la soluzione di gran numero di problemi naturali di Aristotele e di altri suoi detti et opinioni, con discoprirvi manifeste fallacie, et in specie nel trattato De incessu animalium;		
A5849	la libertà della campagna fosse il libro della natura, sempre aperto a chi con gl'occhi dell'intelletto gustava di leggerlo e di studiarlo; dicendo che i caratteri con che era scritto erano le proposizioni, figure e conclusioni geometriche, per il cui solo mezzo potevasi penetrare alcuno delli infiniti misterii dell'istessa natura. Era perciò provvisto di pochissimi libri, ma questi de' migliori e di prima classe: lodava ben sì il vedere quanto in filosofia e geometria era stato scritto di buono, per dilucidare e svegliar la mente a simili e più alte speculazioni; ma ben diceva che le principali porte per introdursi nel ricchissimo erario della natural filosofia erano l'osservazioni e l'esperienze, che, per mezzo delle chiavi de' sensi, da i più nobili e curiosi intelletti si potevano aprire.

A5852	Ebbe assai più in odio l'avarizia che la prodigalità.		
A5853	Spese liberalmente in sollevar i depressi, in ricevere et onorare forestieri, in somministrar le comodità necessarie a poveri, eccellenti in qualch'arte o professione, mantenendogli in casa propria finché gli provvedesse di convenevol trattenimento.		
A5854	Non fu il Sig.r Galileo ambizioso delli onori del volgo,		
A5855	La modestia gli fu sempre compagna; in lui mai si conobbe vanagloria o iattanza.		
A5856	Fu nelle conversazioni universalmente amabilissimo, poiché discorrendo sul serio era ricchissimo di sentenze e concetti gravi, e ne' discorsi piacevoli l'arguzie et i sali non gli mancavano.		
A5857	Fu dotato dalla natura d'esquisita memoria; e gustando in estremo la poesia, aveva a mente, tra gl'autori latini, gran parte di Vergilio, d'Ovidio, Orazio e di Seneca, e tra i toscani quasi tutto 'l Petrarca, tutte le rime del Berni, e poco meno che tutto il poema di Lodovico Ariosto, che fu sempre il suo autor favorito e celebrato sopra gl'altri poeti, avendogli intorno fatte particolari osservazioni e paralleli col Tasso sopra moltissimi luoghi.		
A5858	Rinovò nella patria, e si può dire nell'Italia, le matematiche e la vera filosofia; e questo non solo con le pubbliche e private lezzioni nelle città di Pisa, Padova, Venezia, Roma e Firenze, ma ancora con le continue dispute che ne' congressi avanti di lui si facevano, instruendo particolarmente moltissimi curiosi ingegni e gran numero di gentiluomini, con lor notabili acquisti. Et in vero il Sig.r Galileo ebbe dalla natura così maravigliosa abilità d'erudire, che gli stessi scolari facevan in breve tempo conoscer la grandezza del loro maestro.		
A5859	con le continue dispute che ne' congressi avanti di lui si facevano, instruendo particolarmente moltissimi curiosi ingegni e gran numero di gentiluomini, con lor notabili acquisti.		
A5860	Accrescevasi questo grido dal talento sopranaturale ch'egl'ebbe nell'esaltar le facultà matematiche sopra tutte l'altre scienze, dimostrando con assai ricca et maestosa maniera le più belle e curiose conclusioni che trar si possino dalla geometria, esplicandole con maravigliosa facilità, con utile e diletto insieme delli ascoltanti.		
A5861	che se così fosse facile il far raccolta delle sue ingegnose risposte come si può dell'altrui proposte, certo è che si accumulerebbe un tesoro di inestimabil valore,		
A5862	istorica purità		
A5863	vivacità del suo ingegno, poiché nell'ore di spasso esercitavasi per lo più in fabbricarsi di propria mano varii strumenti e machinette, con imitare e porre in piccol modello ciò che vedeva d'artifizioso, come di molini, galere, et anco d'ogni altra macchina ben volgare.		
A5864	non gli pareva di dover così facilmente assentire a' soli detti et opinioni delli antichi o moderni scrittori, mentre potevasi col discorso e con sensate esperienze appagar sé medesimo		
A5865	E perciò nelle dispute di conclusioni naturali fu sempre contrario alli più acerrimi difensori d'ogni detto Aristotelico, acquistandosi nome tra quelli di spirito della contradizione, et in premio delle scoperte verità provocandosi l'odio loro;		
A5866	evidenza		
A5867	con la sagacità del suo ingegno inventò quella semplicissima e regolata misura del tempo per mezzo del pendulo		
A5868	adattarla all'uso della medicina per la misura della frequenza de' polsi, con stupore e diletto de' medici di que' tempi e come pure oggi si pratica volgarmente

A5887	fu questi necessitato a publicare una sua Difesa in volgare, per evidente dimostrazione di furto così detestabile e vergognoso; difendendosi insieme dalle calunnie et imposture del medesimo Capra,		
A5888	Nel 1607 trovandosi il Galileo fieramente offeso e provocato da un certo Baldassar Capra milanese, che si era allora temerariamente appropriata l'invenzione del suddetto compasso col tradurlo in latino e stamparlo nell'istessa città di Padova in faccia del medesimo autore, con titolo di Usus et fabrica circini cuiusdam proportionis, fu questi necessitato a publicare una sua Difesa in volgare, per evidente dimostrazione di furto così detestabile e vergognoso; difendendosi insieme dalle calunnie et imposture del medesimo Capra, il quale in una sua Considerazione astronomica circa la stella nuova del 1604, stampata già più di due anni avanti, l'aveva acerbamente lacerato, mosso da invidia per l'universale applauso che avevano ricevuto le tre suddette lezzioni del Galileo, fatte sopra la nuova stella.		
A5889	Ma il Capra per mezzo di queste sue abominevoli azzioni ne riportò il dovuto premio d'una perpetua ignominia,		
A5890	Ma il Capra per mezzo di queste sue abominevoli azzioni ne riportò il dovuto premio d'una perpetua ignominia, poiché dalli Eccel.mi SS. Reformatori dello Studio di Padova, dopo essersi, con rigoroso processo formato contro di quello, assicurati a pieno di tanta temerità, fu comandato supprimersi tutte le copie stampate del libro di detto Capra e proibitone la publicazione, et all'incontro conceduto al Galileo d'esporre alla luce la suddetta Difesa, per ricatto della propria reputazione et oppressione di quella del medesimo Capra.		
A5891	ingegnoso compasso del Galileo		
A5892	opere et invenzioni di assai maggior maraviglia		
A5893	Ma l'ardire di questi o l'ingratitudine, oltre al farsi palese dalla suddetta Difesa, vien dannata dalla medesima azione, et autenticata dalla gloriosa fama del Galileo, che per l'altre opere et invenzioni di assai maggior maraviglia si è poi saputo acquistare sopra quelli che pochi altri et assai deboli parti col proprio ingegno hanno saputo produrre.		
A5894	n gradimento di così nobil regalo fu immediatamente, con generosa dimostrazione della Ser.ma Republica, ne' 25 d'Agosto del 1609 ricondotto il Sig.r Galileo a vita sua alla medesima lettura, con più che triplicato stipendio del maggiore che fusse solito assegnarsi a' lettori di matematica.		
A5895	et allora inventò i microscopii d'un convesso e di un concavo, et insieme d'uno e di più convessi, applicandogli a scrupolosa osservazione de' minimi componenti delle materie e della mirabile struttura delle parti e membra delli insetti, nella piccolezza de' quali fece con maraviglia vedere la grandezza di Dio e le miracolose operazioni della natura.		
A5896	lasciando di rimirar gl'oggetti terreni, si rivolse a contemplazioni più nobili.

Cosimo de' Medici non cedé punto a questa comune curiosità la sua regia munificenza, poi che volle con propria lettera de' 10 Luglio 1610 richiamarlo di Padova al suo servizio con titolo di Primario e Sopraordinario Matematico dello Studio di Pisa, senz'obligo di leggervi o risedervi, e di Primario Filosofo e Matematico della sua Ser.ma Altezza, assegnandogli a vita amplissimo stipendio, proporzionato alla somma generosità di un tanto Principe.

A5909	Contro la dottrina di tal Discorso si sollevò tutta la turba peripatetica, et immediatamente si veddero piene le stamperie di opposizioni et apologie, alle quali fu poi nel 1615 abondantemente risposto dal P. D. Benedetto Castelli, matematico allora di Pisa e già discepolo del Sig.r Galileo, a fine di sottrarre il suo maestro da occuparsi in così frivole controversie.		
A5910	et avendo ricevuto lettera dal Sig.r Marco Velsero, Duumviro d'Augusta, accompagnata con tre del suddetto Apelle sopra l'istesso argumento, ne i 4 di Maggio del 1612 rispose a quella con varie considerazioni sopra le lettere del medesimo Apelle, replicando ancora con altra de' 14 d'Agosto susseguente; e ricevendo dal Sig.r Velsero altre speculazioni e discorsi d'Apelle, scrisse la terza lettera del primo di Dicembre prossimo, sempre confermandosi con nuove e più accurate ragioni ne' suoi concetti: e di qui nacque l' Istoria e Demostrazioni delle Macchie Solari e loro accidenti, che nel 1613 fu publicata in Roma dall'Accademia de' Lincei insieme con le suddette lettere e disquisizioni del finto Apelle, dedicandola al medesimo Sig.r Filippo Salviati, nella villa del quale aveva il Sig.r Galileo osservato e scritto sopra queste apparenze; vedendosi in detta istoria ciò che di vero, o di probabile almeno, è stato detto fin ora sopra argumento così difficile e dubbio.		
A5911	Poi che il suddetto Matematico, offendendosi fuor del dovere e contro l'obligo di filosofo che le sue proposizioni non fossero ammesse senz'altro esame per infallibili e vere, o pure anche invidiando alla novità de' concetti così dottamente spiegati nel sopradetto Discorso delle Comete, indi a poco publicò una certa sua Libra astronomica e filosofica, mascherata con finto nome di Lotario Sarsio Sigensano, nella quale trattando con termini poco discreti il Sig.r Mario Guiducci e con molesti punture il Sig.r Galileo, necessitò questo a rispondere col suo Saggiatore, scritto in forma di lettera al Sig.r D. Virginio Cesarini, stampato in Roma nel 1623 dalli Accademici Lincei e dedicato al Sommo Pontefice Urbano Ottavo; per la qual opera chiaramente si scorge, quanto si deva alle persecuzioni delli emuli del Sig.r Galileo, ch'in certo modo sono stati autori di grandissimi acquisti in filosofia, destando in quello concetti altissimi e peregrine speculazioni, delle quali per altro saremmo forse restati privi.		
A5912	Ma essendosi già il Sig.r Galileo per l'altre sue ammirabili speculazioni con immortal fama sin al cielo inalzato, e con tante novità acquistatosi tra gl'uomini del divino, permesse l'Eterna Providenza ch'ei dimostrasse l'umanità sua con l'errare, mentre nella discussione de' due sistemi si dimostrò più aderente all'ipotesi Copernicana, già dannata da S. Chiesa come repugnante alla Divina Scrittura. Fu perciò il Sig.r Galileo, dopo la publicazione de' suoi Dialogi, chiamato a Roma dalla Congregazione del S. Offizio: dove giunto intorno alli 10 di Febbraio 1632 ab Incarnatione, dalla somma clemenza di quel Tribunale e del Sovrano Pontefice Urbano Ottavo, che già per altro lo conosceva troppo benemerito alla republica de' letterati, fu arrestato nel delizioso palazzo della Trinità de' Monti appresso l'ambasciador di Toscana, et in breve (essendogli dimostrato il suo errore) retrattò, come vero catolico, questa sua opinione

A5936	To remember that I promise onely probable arguments for the proofe of this opinion, and therefore you must not looke that every consequence should be of an undeniable dependance, or that the truth of each argument should be measured by its necessity.		
A5937	Many ancient Philosophers of the better note, have formerly defended this assertion, which I have here laid downe, and it were to be wished, that some of us would more apply our endeavours unto the examination of these old opinions, which though they have for a long time lien neglected by others, yet in them may you finde many truths wellworthy your paines and observation.		
A5938	Tis a false conceit, for us to thinke, that amongst the ancient variety and search of opinions, the best hath still prevailed. Time (saith the learned Verulam seemes to be of the nature of a river or streame, which carrieth downe to us that which is light, or blowne up, but sinketh that which is weighty and solid.		
A5939	It is my desire that by the occasion on this discourse, I may raise up some more active spirit to a search after other hidden and unknowne truthes.		
A5940	Since it must needes be a great impediment unto the growth of sciences, for men still so to plod on upon beaten principles, as to be afraid of entertaining any thing that may seeme to contradict them. An unwillingnesse to take such things into examination, is one of those errours of learning in these times observed by the judicious Verulam. Questionlesse there are many secret truths, which the ancients have passed over, that are yet left to make some of our age famous for their discovery.		
A5941	That the strangenesse of this opinion is no sufficient reason why it should be rejected, because other certaine truths have beene formerly esteemed ridiculous, and great absurdities entertayned by common consent.		
A5942	Here is an earnestnesse and hungering after novelty, which doth still adhere unto all our natures, and it is part of that primative image, that wide extent and infinite capacity at first created in the heart of man,		
A5943	Here is an earnestnesse and hungering after novelty,		
A5944	But our enemy the divell (who strives still to pervert our gifts, and beate us with our owne weapons) hath so contriv'd it, that any truth doth now seeme distastefull for that very reason, for which errour is entertain'd—Novelty,		
A5945	the same Novelty which is esteemed the commendation of errour and makes that acceptable, is counted the fault of truth, and causes that to bee rejected.		
A5946	How did the incredulous World gaze at Columbus when hee promised to discover another part of the earth, and he could not for a long time by his confidence, or arguments, induce any of the Christian Princes, either to assent unto his opinion, or goe to the charges of an experiment.		
A5947	Now if he who had such good grounds for his assertion, could finde no better entertainement among the wiser sort, and upper end of the World; 'tis not likely then that this opinion which I now deliver, shall receive any thing from the men of these daies, especially our vulgar wits, but misbeliefe or derision.		
A5948	It hath alwaies beene the unhappinesse of new truths in Philosophy, to be derided by those that are ignorant of the causes of things,		
A5949	reiected by others whose perversenesse ties them to the contrary opinion, men whose envious pride will not allow any new thing for truth which they themselves were not the first inventors of.		
A5950	"For Natales Comes[1] speaking of that Philosopher, and this his opinion, saith thus, Nonnulli ne nihil scisse videantur, aliqua nova monstra in Philosophiā introducunt, ut alicujus rei inventores fuisse appareant. ""Some there are who least they might seeme to know nothing, will bring up monstrous absurdities in Philosophy, that so afterward they may bee famed for the invention of somewhat."" The same author doth also in another place[2] accuse Anaxagoras of folly for the same opinion, Est enim non ignobilis gradus stultitiæ, vel si nescias quid dicas, tamen velle de rebus propositis hanc vel illam partem stabilire. ""'Tis none of the worst kindes of folly, boldly to affirme one side or other, when a man knows not what to say."""		
A5951	I am resolved that this shall not be any discouragement, since I know that it is not the common opinion of others that can either adde or detract from the truth.		
A5952	Other truths have beene formerly esteemed altogether as ridiculous as this can be.		
A5953	Grosse absurdities have beene entertained by generall opinion.		
A5954	hee shall see that the common opposition against this which I affirme cannot any way derogate from its truth.		
A5955	Other truths have beene formerly accounted as ridiculous as this, I shall specifie that of the Antipodes, which have beene denied and laught at by many wise men and great Scholars, such as were Herodotus, St. Austin, Lactantius, the Venerable Bede, Lucretius the Poet, Procopius, and the voluminous Abulensis with others.		
A5956	this great ignorance is not so much to be admired in him, as in those learneder men of later times, when all sciences began to flourish in the World.		
A5957	"Such was Saint Austin who censures that relation of the Antipodes to be an incredible fable[3], and with him agrees the eloquent Lactantius[4], quid illi qui esse contrarios vestigits nostris Antipodes putant? num aliquid loquuntur? aut est quispiam tam ineptus, qui eredat esse homines, quorum vestigia sunt superiora quàm capita? aut ibi quæ apud nos jacent inversa pendere? fruges & arbores deorsum versus crescere, pluvias & nives, & grandinem sursum versus cadere in terram? & miratur aliquis hortos pensiles inter septem mira narrari, quam Philosophi, & agros & maria, & urbes & montes pensiles faciunt? &c. ""What (saith he) are they that thinke there are Antipodes, such as walke with their feet against ours? doe they speake any likelyhood? or is there any one so foolish as to believe that there are men whose heeles are higher than their heads? that things which with us doe lie on the ground doe hang there? that the Plants and Trees grow downewards, that the haile, and raine, and snow fall upwards to the earth? and doe wee admire the hanging Orchards amongst the seven wonders, whereas here the Philosophers have made the Field and Seas, the Cities and Mountains hanging. What shall wee thinke"" (saith hee in Plutarch) that men doe clyng to that place like wormes, or hang by their clawes as Cats, or if wee suppose a man a little beyond the Center, to bee digging with a spade? is it likely (as it must bee according to this opinion) that the earth which hee loosened. should of it selfe ascend upwards? or else suppose two men with their middles about the center, the feete of the one being placed where the head of the other is, and so two other men crosse them, yet all these men thus situated according to this opinion should stand upright, and many other such grosse consequences would follow (saith hee) which a false imagination is not able to fancy as possible. Upon which considerations, Bede[5] also denies the being of any Antipodes, Neá enim Antipodarum nilotenus est Fabulis accommodandus assensus, ""Nor should wee any longer assent to the Fable of Antipodes."" So also Lucretius the Poet speaking of the same subject, sayes:  Sed vanus solidis hæc omnia sinxerit error.[6]"		
A5958	he was perswaded to it by another kinde of reason; for he thought that all the earth under us was sunke in the water, according to the saying of the Psalmist[8], Hee hath founded the Earth upon the Seas, and therefore hee accounted it not inhabited by any.		
A5959	Nay Testatus a man of later yeeres and generall learning doth also confidently deny that there are any such Antipodes, though the reason which hee urges for it bee not so absurde as the former, for the Apostles[9], saith hee, travelled through the whole habitable world, but they never passed the Equinoctiall; and if you answer that they are said to goe through all the earth, because they went through all the knowne world, hee replies, that this is not sufficient, since Christ would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of his truth[10], and therefore 'tis requisite that they should have travelled thither also, if there had been any inhabitants, especially since he did expressely command them to goe and teach all nations[11], and preach the Gospell through the whole world, and therefore he thinkes that as there are no men, so neither are there seas, or rivers, or any other conveniency for habitation: 'tis commonly related of one Virgilius. that he was excommunicated and condemned for a Heretiqne by Zachary Bishop of Rome, because hee was not of the same opinion.		
A5960	yet now this truth is as certaine and plaine, as sense or demonstration can make it.		
A5961	Grosse absurdities have beene entertained by generall consent. I might instance in many remarkeable examples, but will onely speake of the supposed labour of the Moone in her eclipses, because this is neerest to the chiefe matter in hand, and was received as a common opinion amongst many of the ancients, and therefore Plutarch speaking of a Lunary eclipse, relates that at such times 'twas a custome amongst the Romanes (the most civill and learned people in the world) to sound brasse Instruments, and hold great torches toward the heaven. Των δε Ρωμαίων (ωσπερ εςιν ενομισμενον) χαλκψ τε πατάγοις ἀνακαλὃυμενων το φως αὐτὸς καὶ πυρὰ πολλὰ δαλοῖς καὶ δασσὶν ἀνεχόντων ωρὸς τὸν ψρανὸν. [13] for by this meanes they supposed the Moone was much eased in her labours, and therfore Ovid calls such loud Instruments the auxiliaries or helpes of the Moone.		
A5962	And those Wizards knowing the times of her eclipses, would then threaten to shew their skill, by pulling her out of her orbe.		
A5963	So that when the silly multitude saw that she began to looke red, they presently feared they should lose the benefit of her light, and therefore made a great noise that she might not heare the sound of those Charmes,		
A5964	but whether this or what ever else was the meaning of this superstition, yet certainly 'twas a very ridiculous Stome, and bewrayed a great ignorance of those ancient times, especially since it was not onely received by the vulgar, such as were men of Iesse note and Iearning, but believed also, by the more famous and wiser sort		
A5965	there is absurdity enough in that former custome of the ancients, that may confirme the truth to be proved, and plainly declare the insufficiency of common opinion to adde true worth or estimation unto any thing. So that from that which I have said may be gathered thus much.		
A5966	plainly declare the insufficiency of common opinion to adde true worth or estimation unto any thing. So that from that which I have said may be gathered thus much.		
A5967	That a new truth may seeme absurd and impossible not onely to the vulgar, but to those also who are otherwise wise men, and excellent schollers; and hence it will follow, that every new thing which seemes to oppose common Principles is not presently to be rejected, but rather to be pry'd into with a diligent enquiry, since there are many things which are yet hid from us, and reserv'd for future discovery.		
A5968	rather to be pry'd into with a diligent enquiry, since there are many things which are yet hid from us, and reserv'd for future discovery.		
A5969	That it is not the commonnesse of an opinion that can priviledge it for a truth,		
A5970	True indeed, the strangenesse of this opinion will detract much from its credit; but yet we should know that nothing is in its selfe strange, since every natural effect has an equall dependance upon its cause, and with the like necessity doth follow from it, so that 'tis our ignorance which makes things appear so, and hence it comes to passe that many more evident truths seeme incredible to such who know not the causes of things:		
A5971	you may as soone perswade some Country peasants that the Moone is made of greene Cheese (as wee say) as that 'tis bigger than his Cart-wheele, since both seeme equally to contradict his sight, and hee has not reason enough to leade him farther than his senses.		
A5972	Just so will this truth which I now deliver appeare unto others; because we never dreamt of any such matter as a world in the Moone, because the state of that place hath as yet been vailed from our knowledge, therefore wee can scarcely assent to any such matter.		
A5973	Things are very hardly received which are altogether strange to our thoughts and our senses.		
A5974	The soule may with lesse difficulty be brought to believe any absurdity, when as it has formerly beene acquainted with some colours and probabilities for it, but when a new, and an unheard of truth shall come before it, though it have good grounds and reasons, yet the understanding is afraid of it as a stranger, and dares not admit it into its beliefe without a great deale of reluctancy and tryall.		
A5975	The strangenesse then of this opinion which I now deliver will be a great hinderance to its beliefe, but this is not to be respected by reason it cannot bee helped. I have stood the longer in the Preface, because that prejudice which the meere title of the booke may beget cannot easily be removed without a great deale of preparation, and I could not tell otherwise how to rectifie the thoughts of the Reader for an impartiall survey of the following discourse.		
A5976	I must needs confesse, though I had often thought with my selfe that it was possible there might be a world in the Moone, yet it seemed such an uncouth opinion that I never durst discover it, for feare of being counted singular and ridiculous, but afterward having read Plutarch, Galilæus, Keplar, with some others, and finding many of mine owne thoughts confirmed by such strong authority, I then concluded that it was not onely possible there might bee, but probable that there was another habitable world in that Planet.		
A5977	having read Plutarch, Galilæus, Keplar, with some others, and finding many of mine owne thoughts confirmed by such strong authority, I then concluded that it was not onely possible there might bee, but probable that there was another habitable world in that Planet.		
A5978	In the prosecuting of this assertion, I shall first endeavour to cleare the way from such doubts as may hinder the speed or ease of farther progresse; and because the suppositions imply'd in this opinion may seeme to contradict the principles of reason or faith, it will be requisite that I first remove this scruple, shewing the conformity of them to both these, and proving those truths that may make way for the rest;		
A5979	That a plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of reason or faith.		
A5980	hee censured that manner of writing to be very unfitting for a Philosopher because there was nothing proved in them, but matters were delivered as if they would rather command than perswade beliefe.		
A5981	matters were delivered as if they would rather command than perswade beliefe.		
A5982	he confirmes it by the strongest reasons that may be found,		
A5983	But now all the arguments which he himselfe urges in this subject, are very weake and farre enough from having in them any convincing power. Therefore 'tis likely that a plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of reason.		
A5984	However, I will set downe the two chiefe of his arguments from his owne works, and from them you may guesse the force of the other.		
A5985	But our opposites the Interpreters themselves, (who too often doe jurare in verba magistri) will grant that there is not any strength in these consequences, and certainely their such weake arguments could not convince that wise Philosopher, who in his other opinions was wont to bee swayed by the strength and power of reason: wherefore I should rather thinke that he had some by-respect, which made him first assent to this opinion, and afterwards strive to prove it.		
A5986	Aristotle himselfe was as loth to hold the possibility of a world which he could not discover, as Alexander was to heare of one which he could not conquer. Tis likely that some such by-respect moved him to this opinion, since the arguments he urges for it are confest by his zealous followers and commentators, to be very sleight and frivolous, and they themselves grant, what I am now to prove, that there is not any evidence in the light of naturall reason, which can sufficiently manifest that there is but one world.		
A5987	To it I answer, that this position in Philosophy, doth not bring any inconvenience to the rest, since tis not Aristotle, but truth that should be the rule of our opinions,		
A5988	Plato were his friend, yet hee would rather adhere to truth than him		
A5989	I must needs grant, that wee are all much beholden to the industry of the ancient Philosophers, and more especially to Aristotle, for the greater part of our learning, but yet tis not ingratitude to speake against him, when hee opposeth truth;		
A5990	tis not ingratitude to speake against him, when hee opposeth truth;		
A5991	But suppose this opinion were false, yet ’tis not against the faith, and so it may serve for the better confirmation of that which is true; the sparkes of errour, being forc’d out by opposition, as the sparkes of fire, by the striking of the flint and steele. But suppose too that it were hereticall, and against the faith, yet may it be admitted with the same priviledge as Aristotle, from whom many more dangerous opinions have proceeded: as that the world is eternall, that God cannot have while to looke after these inferiour things, that after death there is no reward or punishment, and such like blasphemies, which strike directly at the fundamentalls of our Religion.		
A5992	So that it is justly to be wondred why some should be so superstitious in these daies, as to sticke closer unto him, than unto Scripture, as if his Philosophy were the onely foundation of all divine truths.		
A5993	I thinke the world is much beholden to Aristotle for all it sciences. But yet twere a shame for these later ages to rest our selves meerely upon the labours of our Fore-fathers, as if they had informed us of all things to be knowne, and when wee are set upon their shoulders, not to see further then they themselves did. 'Twere a superstitious, a lazie opinion to thinke Aristotles workes the bounds and limits of all humane invention, beyond which there could be no possibility of reaching. Certainly there are yet many things left to discovery, and it cannot be any inconvenience for us, to maintaine a new truth, or rectifie an ancient errour.		
A5994	But the position (say some) is directly against Scripture, for		
A5995	Unto the two first it may be answered, that the negative authority of Scripture is not prevalent in those things which are not the fundamentalls of Religion.		
A5996	tis besides the scope of the Holy Ghost either in the new Testament or in the old, to reveale any thing unto us concerning the secrets of Philosophy;		
A5997	’Tis not the endeavour of Moses or the Prophets to discover any Mathematicall or Philosophicall subtilties, but rather to accomodate themselves to vulgar capacities, and ordinary speech, as nurses are wont to use their infants.		
A5998	to accomodate themselves to vulgar capacities, and ordinary speech, as nurses are wont to use their infants.		
A5999	declaring the originall chiefely of those things which were obvious to the sense, and being silent of other things, which then could not well be apprehended.		
A6000	Moses writes nothing of the aire, because that being invisible, the people knew not whether there were any such body or no. And for this very reason Saint Austin also thinkes that there is nothing exprest concerning the creation of Angels which notwithstanding are as remarkable parts of the creatures, and as fit to be knowne as another world.		
A6001	the Holy Ghost too uses such vulgar expressions which set things forth rather as they appeare, then as they are,		
A6002	the phrases which the Holy Ghost uses concerning these things are not to be understood in a literall sense; but rather as vulgar expressions, and this rule is set downe by Saint Austin, where speaking concerning that in the Psalme, who stretched the earth upon the waters, [21] [22] hee notes, that when the words of Scripture shall seeme to contradict common sense or experience, there are they to be understood in a qualified sense, and not according to the letter.		
A6003	when the words of Scripture shall seeme to contradict common sense or experience, there are they to be understood in a qualified sense, and not according to the letter.		
A6004	I may conclude that the silence of Scripture concerning any other world is not sufficient argument to prove that there is none.		
A6005	I may answer, that this very example is quoted by others, to shew the ignorance of those primative times, who did sometimes condemne what they did not understand, and have often censur’d the lawfull & undoubted parts of Mathematiques for hereticall, because they themselves could not perceive a reason of it, and therefore their practise in this particular, is no sufficient testimony against us.		
A6006	But lastly I answer to all the above named objections, that the terme World, may be taken in a double sense, more generally for the whole Universe, as it implies in it the elementary and æthereall bodies, the starres and the earth. Secondly, more particularly for an inferiour World consisting of elements.		
A6007	at least not thinke it to be as farre from truth, as it is from common opinion		
A6008	indifferently resolved to assent unto that truth which upon deliberation shall seeme most probable unto thy reason		
A6009	with an equall minde, not swayed by prejudice		
A6010	Many ancient Philosophers of the better note, have formerly defended this assertion, which I have here laid downe, and it were to be wished, that some of us would more apply our endeavours unto the examination of these old opinions, which though they have for a long time lien neglected by others, yet in them may you finde many truths wellworthy your paines and observation. Tis a false conceit, for us to thinke, that amongst the ancient variety and search of opinions, the best hath still prevailed.		
A6011	other hidden and unknowne truthes		
A6012	I may raise up some more active spirit to a search after other hidden and unknowne truthes		
A6013	Questionlesse there are many secret truths, which the ancients have passed over, that are yet left to make some of our age famous for their discovery.		
A6014	That the strangenesse of this opinion is no sufficient reason why it should be rejected, because other certaine truths have beene formerly esteemed ridiculous, and great absurdities entertayned by common consent		
A6015	that any truth doth now seeme distastefull for that very reason, for which errour is entertain'd		
A6016	Novelty, for let but some upstart heresie be set abroach, and presently there are some out of a curious humour; others, as if they watched an occasion of singularity, will take it up for canonicall, and make it part of their creede and profession;—whereas solitary truth cannot any where finde so ready entertainement; but the same Novelty which is esteemed the commendation of errour and makes that acceptable, is counted the fault of truth, and causes that to bee rejected.		
A6017	It hath alwaies beene the unhappinesse of new truths in Philosophy, to be derided by those that are ignorant of the causes of things, and reiected by others whose perversenesse ties them to the contrary opinion, men whose envious pride will not allow any new thing for truth which they themselves were not the first inventors of

A6025	Other truths have beene formerly accounted as ridiculous as this		
A6026	but he was perswaded to it by another kinde of reason; for he thought that all the earth under us was sunke in the water, according to the saying of the Psalmist[8], Hee hath founded the Earth upon the Seas, and therefore hee accounted it not inhabited by any.

A6029	you may well enough discerne in these examples how confident many of these great Schollars were in so grosse an errour, how unlikely, what an incredible thing it seemed to them, that there should be any Antipodes, and yet now this truth is as certaine and plaine, as sense or demonstration can make it

A6045	a new truth		
A6046	Moses tells us but of one world, and his History of the creation had beene very imperfect if God had made another.		
A6047	Saint John speaking of Gods workes, saies he made the world, in the singular number, and therefore there is but one:[12] 'tis the argument of Aquinas, and he thinks that none will oppose it, but such who with Democritus esteeme some blinde chance, and not any wise providence to be the framer of all things		
A6048	The opinion of more worlds has in ancient time beene accounted a heresie, and Baronius affirmes that for this very reason, Virgilius was cast out of his Bishopricke, and excommunicated from the Church		
A6049	if there be more worlds than one, then they must either be of the same, or of a diverse nature, but they are not of the same kinde,[14] for this were needlesse, and would argue an improvidence, since one would have no more perfection than the other; not of divers kinds, for then one of them could not be called the world or universe, since it did not containe universall perfection		
A6050	the best of these hath not force enough to endanger the truth that I have delivered.		
A6051	the negative authority of Scripture is not prevalent in those things which are not the fundamentalls of Religion		
A6052	tis besides the scope of the Holy Ghost either in the new Testament or in the old, to reveale any thing unto us concerning the secrets of Philosophy

A6054	These and such like absurdities have followed, when men looke for the grounds of Philosophie in the words of Scripture.		
A6055	Neither can this opinion derogate from the divine Wisdome (as Aquinas thinkes) but rather advance it, shewing a compendium of providence
