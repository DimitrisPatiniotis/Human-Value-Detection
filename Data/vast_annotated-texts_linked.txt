A1	Once upon a time there was a rich man who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly		
A2	Every morning he was the first one out of bed, and at night the last one to go to bed. Whenever there was a difficult job that nobody wanted to do, he was always the first to volunteer. He never complained at any of this, but was contented with everything and always happy		
A4	The servant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had done before, and when at the end of this year he again received no wages, he still stayed on without complaining		
A6	"However, this time the servant said, ""Master, I have served you honestly for three years. Be so good as to give me what by rights I have coming to me. I would like to be on my way and see something else of the world."""		
A7	"""Yes, my good servant,"" answered the old miser, ""you have served me without complaint, and you shall be kindly rewarded."""		
A8	"With this he put his hand into his pocket, then counted out three hellers one at a time, saying, ""There, you have a heller for each year. That is a large and generous reward. Only a few masters would pay you this much."""		
A12	"""How much is your treasure?"" the dwarf asked him. ""How much? Three hellers in real money, precisely counted."""		
A13	"Now because the servant had a good heart and felt pity for the dwarf, he gave him his three hellers, saying, ""In God's name, I won't miss them."""		
A14	"Then the dwarf said, ""Because I see that you have a good heart I will grant you three wishes, one for each heller. They shall all be fulfilled."""		
A19	As soon as he had thus refreshed himself a little, and caught his breath again, he ran into the town to the judge.		
A20	"""Judge, sir,"" he said, ""Oh, woe is me! See how a godless man has robbed me and abused me on the open road. A stone on the ground would feel sorry for me. My clothes are ripped into shreds. My body is pricked and scratched to pieces. And what little I owned has been taken away with my purse -- genuine ducats, each piece more beautiful than the others. For God's sake, let the man be thrown into prison."""		
A24	"As he was being led away, the Jew screamed after him, ""You good-for-nothing. You dog of a musician. Now you will receive your well earned reward."""		
A25	"The servant walked quietly up the ladder with the hangman, but on the last rung he turned around and said to the judge, ""Grant me just one request before I die."""		
A27	"""I stole it. I stole it,"" he cried. ""But you have honestly earned it."""		
A30	Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife		
A41	"One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, when her little daughter came up too, and said, ""Mother, give me an apple."" ""Yes, my child,"" said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest. The chest had a large heavy lid with a large sharp iron lock."		
A42	"""Mother,"" said the little daughter, ""is brother not to have one too?"""		
A47	Marlene went to her chest of drawers, took her best silk scarf from the bottom drawer, and gathered all the bones from beneath the table and tied them up in her silk scarf, then carried them outside the door, crying tears of blood.		
A49	At the same time a mist seemed to rise from the tree, and in the center of this mist it burned like a fire, and a beautiful bird flew out of the fire singing magnificently, and it flew high into the air, and when it was gone, the juniper tree was just as it had been before, and the cloth with the bones was no longer there.		
A50	My mother, she killed me, My father, he ate me, My sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.		
A52	My mother, she killed me, Then one of them stopped working. My father, he ate me, Then two more stopped working and listened, My sister Marlene, Then four more stopped, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf,		
A53	Laid them beneath		
A54	"""Yes,"" he said, ""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" ""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."" Then the bird came down, and the twenty millers took a beam and lifted the stone up. Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho!"		
A55	He flew far away to a mill, and the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack.		
A56	He flew far away to his father's house.		
A61	"With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully. Then the man went in and said, ""Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks."""		
A62	"Then she was contented and happy. She put on the new red shoes and danced and leaped into the house. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I was so sad when I went out and now I am so contented. That is a splendid bird, he has given me a pair of red shoes."""		
A63	And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death. The father and Marlene heard it and went out. Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.		
A64	"""Marlene,"" said the mother, ""what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it."		
A66	Upon which so strange a spectacle, the people of the city gathered apace together upon the sands, to wonder; and so after put themselves into a number of small boats, to go nearer to this marvellous sight.		
A67	and to discern (as far as appertaineth to the generations of men) between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures and illusions of all sorts.		
A69	It is dedicated to the study of the works and creatures of God.

A99	E qui sta anco un libro in lettere d'oro di cose importantissime.		
A102	Sapienza		
A109	tra loro non possono donarsi cosa alcuna, perché tutto hanno del commune, e molto guardano gli offiziali, che nullo abbia più che merita. Però quanto è bisogno tutti l'hanno. E l'amico si conosce tra loro nelle guerre, nell'infirmità, nelle scienze, dove s'aiutano e s'insegnano l'un l'altro. E tutti li gioveni s'appellan frati e quei che son quindici anni più di loro, padri, e quindici meno figli. E poi vi stanno l'offiziali a tutte cose attenti, che nullo possa all'altro far torto nella fratellanza.		
A111	bugia, che abborriscono più che la peste;		
A112	non sendo tra loro latrocini, né assassinii, né stupri ed incesti, adultèri, delli quali noi ci accusamo		
A113	Giustizia		
A114	Verità		
A115	di questi rei per pena son privati della mensa commune, o del commerzio delle donne, e d'alcuni onori, finché pare al giudice, per ammendarli.		
A121	han potestà di battere o far battere da altri li negligenti e disobedienti,		
A122	notano ognuno ed ognuna in che esercizio meglio riesce.		
A125	Gli offiziali hanno la miglior parte; questi mandano spesso della loro a tavola a chi più si ha fatto onore la mattina nelle lezioni e dispute di scienze ed armi, e questo si stima per grande onore e favore.		
A126	Hanno in tutte le piazze delli gironi le lor fontane, che tirano l'acque dal fondo solo con muover un legno, onde esse spicciano per li canali.		
A127	Negli atri di fuora son orologi di sole e di squille per tutti i gironi, e banderuole per saper i venti.		
A131	Il che non può avvenire al nostro Sole, perché non può arrivare a tante scienze chi non è scaltro d'ingegno ad ogni cosa, onde è sempre attivissimo al governo.		
A132	Ma tutti questi offiziali han d'essere filosofi, e più, ed istorici, naturalisti ed umanisti.		
A142	La superbia è tenuta per gran peccato, e si punisce un atto di superbia in quel modo che l'ha commesso.		
A143	non tengono schiavi, perché essi bastano a se stessi, anzi soverchiano.		
A154	Nell'assalti, chi prima saglie il muro ha dopo in onore una corona di gramigna con applauso militare delle donne e fanciulli. Chi aiuta il compagno ha la corona civica di quercia; chi uccide il tiranno, le spoglie opime, che porta al tempio, e si dona al Sole il cognome dell'impresa.		
A155	Ci son poi li trionfi militari ad uso di Romani, e più belli, e le supplicazioni ringraziatorie. E si presenta al tempio il capitano, e si narrano li gesti dal poeta o istorico ch'andò con lui. E 'l Principe lo corona, ed a tutti soldati fa qualche regalo ed onore, e per molti dì sono esenti dalle fatiche publiche.		
A157	Chi non aiutò l'amico o fe' atto vile, è frustato; chi fu disobediente, si mette a morire dentro a un palco di bestie con un bastone in mano, e se vince i leoni e l'orsi, che è quasi impossibile, torna in grazia.		
A158	Perdonano volentieri a' nemici e dopo la vittoria li fanno bene. Se gettano mura o vogliono occider i capi o altro danno a' vinti, tutto fanno in un giorno, e poi li fanno bene, e dicono che non si deve far guerra se non per far gli uomini buoni, non per estinguerli.		
A162	L'agricoltura è in gran stima: non ci è palmo di terra che non frutti. Osservano li venti e le stelle propizie, ed escono tutti in campo armati ad arare, seminare, zappare, metere, raccogliere, vindemmiare, con musiche, trombe e stendardi; ed ogni cosa fanno tra pochissime ore. Hanno le carra a vela, che caminano con il vento, e quando non ci è vento, una bestia tira un gran carro, bella cosa, ed han li guardiani del territorio armati, che per li campi sempre van girando. Poco usano letame all'orti ed a' campi, dicendo che li semi diventano putridi e fan vita breve, come le donne imbellettate e non belle per esercizio fanno prole fiacca. Onde né pur la terra imbellettano, ma ben l'esercitano, ed hanno gran secreti di far nascer presto e multiplicare, e non perder seme. E tengon un libro a posta di tal esercizio, che si chiama la Georgica. Una parte del territorio, quanto basta, si ara; l'altra serve per pascolo delle bestie. Or questa nobil arte di far cavalli, bovi, pecore, cani ed ogni sorte d'animali domestici è in sommo pregio appresso loro, come fu in tempo antico d'Abramo; e con modi magici li fanno venire al coito, che possan ben generare, inanzi a cavalli pinti o bovi o pecore; e non lasciano andar in campagna li stalloni con le giumente, ma li donano a tempo opportuno inanzi alle stalle di campagna. Osservano Sagittario in ascendente, con buono aspetto di Marte e Giove: per li bovi, Tauro, per le pecore, Ariete, secondo l'arte. Hanno poi mandre di galline sotto le Pleiadi e papare e anatre, guidate a pascere dalle donne con gusto loro presso alla città e li luochi, dove la sera son serrate a far il cascio e latticini, butiri e simili. Molto attendono a' caponi ed a' castrati ed al frutto, e ci è un libro di quest'arte detto la Bucolica.		
A166	navigano per conoscer genti e paesi.		
A167	Dicono che il mondo averà da riducersi a vivere come essi fanno, però cercano sempre sapere se altri vivono meglio di loro.		
A168	Hanno anche gran secreti di fuochi artifiziali per le guerre marine e terrestri, e stratagemme, che mai non restan di vincere.		
A170	Segno d'ingegno grande,		
A175	quando occorre caso ingiurioso, l'omicidio si punisce con morte, ed occhio per occhio, naso per naso si paga la pena della pariglia,		
A176	s'appella pure al Metafisico per grazia, non per giustizia, e quello può far la grazia.		
A181	tutti gli offiziali son sacerdoti, parlando delli capi, ed offizio loro è purgar le conscienze.		
A182	Talché tutti si confessano a quelli, ed essi imparano che sorti di peccati regnano.		
A188	Ma chi dice bugia in laude è punito; non si può dir poeta chi finge menzogna tra loro; e questa licenza dicono che è ruina del mondo, che toglie il premio alle virtù e lo dona altrui per paura o adulazione.		
A191	Però essi cercano assai sottilmente questo negozio, perché importa a saper la fabbrica del mondo, e se perirà e quando, e la sostanza delle stelle e chi ci sta dentro a loro.		
A196	Stanno anche molto curiosi		
A202	"""Quel che non vuoi per te non far ad altri, e quel che vuoi per te fa' tu il medesimo."""		
A204	Oh, se sapessi che cosa dicono per astrologia e per l'istessi profeti nostri ed ebrei e d'altre genti di questo secolo nostro, c'ha più storia in cento anni che non ebbe il mondo in quattro mila; e più libri si fecero in questi cento che in cinque mila: e dell'invenzioni stupende della calamita e stampe ed archibugi, gran segni dell'union del mondo; e come, stando nella triplicità quarta l'asside di Mercurio a tempo che le congiunzioni magne si faceano in Cancro, fece queste cose inventare per la Luna e Marte, che in quel segno valeno al navigar novo, novi regni e nove armi. Ma entrando l'asside di Saturno in Capricorno, e di Mercurio in Sagittario, e di Marte in Vergine, e le congiunzioni magne tornando alla triplicità prima dopo l'apparizion della stella nova in Cassiopea, sarà grande monarchia nova, e di leggi riforma e d'arti, e profeti e rinovazione. E dicono che a' cristiani questo apporterà grand'utile; ma prima si svelle e monda, poi s'edifica e pianta.		
A205	Questo sappi, c'han trovato l'arte del volare, che sola manca al mondo, ed aspettano un occhiale di veder le stelle occulte ed un oricchiale d'udir l'armonia delli moti di pianeti.		
A208	Questo si sappi, che essi tengon la libertà dell'arbitrio.		
A209	chi segue più il senso che la ragione è soggetto a loro.		
A210	le stelle nelli sensuali inchinano a quella, nelli razionali alla vera legge santa della prima Raggione, sempre laudanda.		
A211	Dimmi, di grazia, tutto quello che t'avvenne in questa navigazione.		
A215	E' la città distinta in sette gironi grandissimi, nominati dalli sette pianeti, e s'entra dall'uno all'altro per quattro strade e per quattro porte, alli quattro angoli del mondo spettanti;		
A216	la porta Tramontana, di ferro coperta, fatta che s'alza e cala con bello ingegno,		
A217	stupendo artifizio.		
A218	Sopra l'altare non vi è altro ch'un mappamondo assai grande, dove tutto il cielo è dipinto, ed un altro dove è la terra. Poi sul cielo della cupola vi stanno tutte le stelle maggiori del cielo, notati coi nomi loro e virtù, c'hanno sopra le cose terrene, con tre versi per una; ci sono i poli e i circoli signati non del tutto, perché manca il muro a basso, ma si vedono finiti in corrispondenza alli globbi dell'altare. Vi sono sempre accese sette lampade nominate dalli sette pianeti.		
A220	Il Metafisico tratta tutti questi negozi con loro, ché senza lui nulla si fa, ed ogni cosa la communicano essi quattro, e dove il Metafisico inchina, son d'accordo.		
A223	Tutte cose son communi; ma stan in man di offiziali le dispense, onde non solo il vitto, ma le scienze e onori e spassi son communi, ma in maniera che non si può appropriare cosa alcuna.		
A224	Dunque nullo vorrà fatigare, mentre aspetta che l'altro fatighi,		
A226	li fanciulli imparano la lingua e l'alfabeto nelle mura,		
A227	Dopo li sette anni vanno alle lezioni delle scienze naturali, tutti;		
A228	Poi tutti si mettono alle matematiche, medicine ed altre scienze,		
A229	Ed in campagna, nei lavori e nella pastura delle bestie pur vanno a imparare; e quello è tenuto di più gran nobiltà, che più arti impara, e meglio le fa.		
A233	Si dona a ciascuno, secondo il suo esercizio, piatto di pitanza e menestra, frutti, cascio;		
A237	Se si trovano in sodomia, sono vituperati, e li fan portare due giorni legata al collo una scarpa, significando che pervertiro l'ordine e posero li piedi in testa, e la seconda volta crescen la pena finché diventa capitale.		
A238	Ma chi si astiene fin a ventun anno d'ogni coito è celebrato con alcuni onori e canzoni.		
A244	Onde agli eroi ed eroisse la republica fa certi doni, in tavola o in feste publiche, di ghirlande o di vestimenta belle fregiate;		
A249	ricchi, ch'ogni cosa hanno e possedono;		
A251	vanno spiando di tutte nazioni l'usanze, e sempre migliorano;		
A255	talché manca il servizio publico, e non si può il campo, la milizia e l'arti fare, se non male e con stento.		
A258	ed ognuno piglia parte della pena.		
A264	Se tra loro ci è qualche gara d'ingiuria o d'altro, perché essi non contendono se non di onore, il Principe ed i suoi offiziali puniscono il reo secretamente, s'incorse ad ingiuria di fatto dopo le prime ire; se di parole, aspettano in guerra a diffinirle, dicendo che l'ira si deve sfogare contra l'inimici.		
A266	E se sono in campo aperto, serrano le bagaglie in mezzo e l'artellerie, e combattono gran pezzo, e poi fan ritirata. E 'l nemico, credendo che cedano, s'inganna; perché essi fanno ala, pigliano fiato e lasciano l'artiglierie sparare, e poi tornano alla zuffa contra nemici scompigliati.		
A270	non escono di regola.		
A271	è tenuto a vergogna che uno si vegga sputare, dicendo che questo nasce da poco esercizio, da poltroneria o da mangiar ingordo.		
A275	ingegno		
A276	Il Sapienza ha cura di tutte le scienze e delli dottori e magistrati dell'arti liberali e meccaniche		
A277	li figliuoli, senza fastidio, giocando, si trovano saper tutte le scienze istoricamente prima che abbin dieci anni		
A279	Però quanto è bisogno tutti l'hanno. E l'amico si conosce tra loro nelle guerre, nell'infirmità, nelle scienze, dove s'aiutano e s'insegnano l'un l'altro.		
A280	Liberalità		
A281	Magnanimità		
A282	Beneficienza		
A283	Misericordia		
A284	e di questi rei per pena son privati della mensa commune, o del commerzio delle donne, e d'alcuni onori, finché pare al giudice, per ammendarl		
A286	tutti		
A287	ci è continua disputa tra di loro e concorrenza		
A288	Però non può essere Sole se non quello che sa tutte l'istorie delle genti e riti e sacrifizi e republiche ed inventori di leggi ed arti. Poi bisogna che sappia tutte l'arti meccaniche, perché ogni due giorni se n'impara una, ma l'uso qui le fa saper tutte, e la pittura. E tutte le scienze ha da sapere, matematiche, fisiche, astrologiche.		
A289	scaltro d'ingegno		
A290	non può arrivare a tante scienze chi non è scaltro d'ingegno ad ogni cosa		
A291	Ma non così avviene alli pronti d'ingegno e facili ad ogni conoscenza, come è bisogno che sia il Sole		
A292	Poi son l'arti communi agli uomini e donne

A299	s'amano grandemente ed aiutano l'un l'altro		
A300	si punisce un atto di superbia in quel modo che l'ha commesso		
A301	Però la communità tutti li fa ricchi e poveri: ricchi, ch'ogni cosa hanno e possedono; poveri, perché non s'attaccano a servire alle cose, ma ogni cosa serve a loro		
A303	quei che per loro colpa han perduto, si ricevono con vituperio, e chi fu il primo a fuggire non può scampar la morte		
A304	se non quando tutto l'esercito domanda in grazia la sua vita, ed ognuno piglia parte della pena		
A305	E si ragiona di quel che bisogna al publico		
A306	ognun è giudicato da quello dell'arte sua		
A307	punisce d'esilio, di frusta, di vituperio, di non mangiar in mensa commune, di non andar in chiesa, non parlar alle donne		
A308	ogni capo dell'arte è giudice, e punisce d'esilio, di frusta, di vituperio, di non mangiar in mensa commune, di non andar in chiesa, non parlar alle donne		
A309	l'omicidio si punisce con morte, ed occhio per occhio, naso per naso si paga la pena della pariglia, quando è caso pensato		
A310	Non si scrive processo, ma in presenza del giudice e del Potestà si dice il pro e il contra		
A311	Questi soli si puniscono con morte		
A312	lo mandano in esilio		
A313	Li falli di fragilità e d'ignoranza si puniscono solo con vituperi, e con farlo imparare a contenersi		
A314	secondo il merito		
A316	essi tengon la libertà dell'arbitrio		
A325	The Lady now finding her self in so strange a place, and amongst such wonderful kind of Creatures, was extreamly strucken with fear, and could entertain no other Thoughts, but that every moment her life was to be a sacrifice to their cruelty; but those Bear-like Creatures, how terrible soever they appear'd to her sight, yet were they so far from exercising any cruelty upon her, that rather they shewed her all civility and kindness imaginable;		
A328	Very good Navigators they were; and though they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile observations, and great practice;		
A334	Of the States men she enquired, first, Why they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last brake out into open Wars.		
A345	This observation amazed the Empress very much; for she had hitherto believed, That Snow was made by cold motions, and not by such an agitation or beating of a fiery extract upon water: Nor could she be perswaded to believe it until the Fish- or Mear-men had delivered their observation upon the making of Ice,		
A346	This Relation confirmed partly the observation of the Bird-men concerning the cause of Snow;		
A347	to avoid hereafter tedious disputes, and have the truth of the Phænomena's of Cœlestial Bodies more exactly known, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers, to observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which they did according to her Majesties Command;		
A350	the Empress began to grow angry at their Telescopes, that they could give no better Intelligence; for, said she, now I do plainly perceive, that your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses; Wherefore I Command you to break them, and let the Bird-men trust onely to their natural eyes, and examine Cœlestial Objects by the motions of their own Sense and Reason.		
A351	if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth;		
A352	if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth; Wherefore I command you again to break them; for you may observe the progressive motions of Cœlestial Bodies with your natural eyes better then through Artificial Glasses.		
A353	for, said they, we take more delight in Artificial delusions, then in Natural truths. Besides, we shall want Imployments for our Senses, and Subjects for Arguments; for, were there nothing but truth, and no falshood, there would be no occasion to dispute, and by this means we should want the aim and pleasure of our endeavors in confuting and contradicting each other; neither would one man be thought wiser then another, but all would either be alike knowing and wise, or all would be fools;		
A357	this was very remarkable and worthy to be taken notice of, that notwithstanding their great skil, industry and ingenuity in Experimental Philosophy, they could yet by no means contrive such Glasses, by the help of which they could spy out a Vacuum, with all its dimensions, nor Immaterial substances, Non-beings, and Mixt-beings, or such as are between something and nothing; which they were very much troubled at, hoping that yet, in time, by long study and practice, they might perhaps attain to it.		
A359	Truly, answered they, Your Majesty puts a very hard question to us, and we shall hardly be able to give a satisfactory answer to it; for there are many different sorts of Creatures, which as they have all different perceptions, so they have also different organs, which our senses are not able to discover, onely in an Oystershell we have with admiration observed, that the common sensorium of the Oyster lies just as the closing of the shells, where the pressure and re-action may be perceived by the opening and shutting of the shells every tide.		
A360	This Relation confirmed the Empress in the opinion concerning the motion of the Earth, and the fixedness of the Sun, as the Bird-men had informed her;		
A362	the Worm-men excused themselves, that they were ignorant in that Art, and that such questions belonged more properly to the Ape-men, which were Her Majesties Chymists.		
A365	After this, and several other Conferences, which the Empress held with the Worm-men, she dismissed them; and having taken much satisfaction in several of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and Observations.		
A369	if this be so, as surely, according to regular Sense and Reason, it appears no otherwise; it is in vain to look for primary Ingredients, or constitutive principles of Natural Bodies, since there is no more but one Universal Principle of Nature,		
A371	The Empress having thus declared her mind to the Ape-men, and given them better Instructions then perhaps they expected, not knowing that her Majesty had such great and able judgment in Natural Philosophy, had several conferences with them concerning Chymical Preperations,		
A372	she knew that Nature's Works are so various and wonderful, that no particular Creature is able to trace her ways.		
A375	Then came the Lice-men, and endeavoured to measure all things to a hairs-breadth, and weigh them to an Atom; but their weights would seldom agree, especially in the weighing of Air, which they found a task impossible to be done; at which the Empress began to be displeased, and told them, that there was neither Truth nor Justice in their Profession; and so dissolved their society.		
A377	I have enough, said she, of your chopt Logick, and will hear no more of your Syllogisms; for it disorders my Reason, and puts my Brain on the rack; your formal argumentations are able to spoil all natural wit; and I'le have you to consider, that Art does not make Reason, but Reason makes Art; and therefore as much as Reason is above Art, so much is a natural rational discourse to be preferred before an artificial:		
A378	your Art of Logick, which consists onely in contradicting each other, in making sophismes, and obscuring Truth, instead of clearing it.		
A388	she asked again, Whether our Fore-fathers had been as wise, as Men were at present, and had understood sense and reason, as well as they did now? They answered, That in former Ages they had been as wise as they are in this present, nay, wiser; for, said they, many in this age do think their Fore-fathers have been Fools, by which they prove themselves to be such.		
A391	It is the nature of Mankind to be inquisitive. Natural desire of knowledg,		
A395	The Duchess told her, That, Sense and Reason would instruct her of a Nature as much as could be known; and as for Numbers, they were infinite; but to add non-sense to infinite, would breed a confusion, especially in Humane Understanding.		
A396	The Duchess answered, That the chief and onely ground in Government, was but Reward and Punishment, and required no further Cabbala;		
A398	At last, when the Duchess saw that no patterns would do her any good in the framing of her World; she was resolved to make a World of her own Invention, and this World was composed of sensitive and rational self-moving Matter; indeed, it was composed onely of the Rational, which is the subtilest and purest degree of Matter; for as the Sensitive did move and act both to the perceptions and consistency of the body, so this degree of Matter at the same point of time (for though the degrees are mixt, yet the several parts may move several ways at one time) did move to the Creation of the Imaginary World;		
A400	it was governed without secret and deceiving Policy; neither was there any ambitious, factions, malicious detractions, civil dissentions, or home-bred quarrels, divisions in Religion, Foreign Wars, &c. but all the people lived in a peaceful society, united Tranquility, and Religious Conformity.		
A404	Many, both of your modern and ancient Philosophers, answered the Spirits, endeavour to go beyond Sense and Reason, which makes them commit absurdities; for no corporeal Creature can go beyond Sense and Reason;		
A413	Beautiful Truth, Great Fortune, and you the rest of my noble Friends; I am come a great and long journey in the behalf of my dear Friend the Duke of Newcastle; not to make more wounds, but, if it be possible, to heal those that are made already. Neither do I presume to be a Deity; but my onely request is, that you would be pleased to accept of my Offering, I being an humble and devout supplicant; and since no offering is more acceptable to the Gods, then the offering of Peace; in order to that, I desire to make an agreement between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle.		
A414	I came not here, said she, to hear Fortune flattered, but to hear the Cause decided between Fortune and the Duke; neither came I hither to speak Rhetorically and Eloquently, but to propound the case plainly and truly;		
A417	he could not trust Fortune with that which he preferred above his life, which was his Reputation, by reason Fortune did not side with those that were honest and honourable, but renounced them; and since he could not be of both sides, he chose to be of that which was agreeable both to his Conscience, Nature and Education;		
A423	One time the Duchess chanced to discourse with some of her acquaintance, of the Empress of the Blazing-World, who asked her what Pastimes and Recreations her Majesty did most delight in? The Duchess answered, That she spent most of her time in the study of Natural Causes and Effects, which was her chief delight and pastime; and that she loved to discourse sometimes with the most Learned persons of that World:		
A424	she loved to discourse sometimes with the most Learned persons of that World:		
A426	I have made my Blazing-World a Peaceable World,		
A427	But I esteeming Peace before Warr, Wit before Policy, Honesty before Beauty; instead of the figures of Alexander, Cesar, Hector, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses, Hellen, &c. chose rather the figure of Honest Margaret Newcastle, which now I would not change for all this Terrestrial World; and if any should like the World I have made, and be willing to be my Subjects, they may imagine themselves such, and they are such, I mean in their Minds, Fancies or Imaginations; but if they cannot endure to be Subjects, they may create Worlds of their own, and Govern themselves as they please. But yet let them have a care, not to prove unjust Usurpers, and to rob me of mine: for, concerning the Philosophical-world, I am Empress of it my self; and as for the Blazing-World, it having an Empress already, who rules it with great Wisdom and Conduct, which Empress is my dear Platonick Friend; I shall never prove so unjust, treacherous and unworthy to her, as to disturb her Government, much less to depose her from her Imperial Throne, for the sake of any other, but rather chuse to create another World for another Friend.		
A429	they had an extraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers,		
A433	though they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile observations, and great practice; in so much that they could not onely tell the depth of the Sea in every place, but where there were shelves of Sand, Rocks, and other obstructions to be avoided by skilful and experienced Sea-men		
A434	they had an extraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers, and that was a certain Engin, which would draw in a great quantity of Air, and shoot forth Wind with a great force; this Engine in a calm, they placed behind their Ships, and in a storm, before; for it served against the raging waves, like Cannons against an hostile Army, or besieged Town		
A435	endeavoured to learn their language		
A436	Novelty discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in peace and tranquillity		
A438	No sooner was the Lady brought before the Emperor, but he conceived her to be some Goddess, and offered to worship her; which she refused, telling him, (for by that time she had pretty well learned their Language) that although she came out of another world, yet was she but a mortal		
A439	At which the Emperor rejoycing, made her his Wife, and gave her an absolute power to rule and govern all that World as she pleased		
A440	the Empress encouraged them in, especially those that had applied themselves to the study of several Arts and Sciences; for they were as ingenious and witty in the invention of profitable and useful Arts, as we are in our world, nay, more		
A441	Why they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last brake out into open Wars.		
A442	to avoid hereafter tedious disputes, and have the truth of the Phænomena's of Cœlestial Bodies more exactly known, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers, to observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which they did according to her Majesties Command		
A443	your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses		
A444	Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth		
A447	as Experience doth sufficiently witness		
A448	But since you have informed me, said she, of the various sorts and productions of Animal Creatures, I desire you to tell me what you have observed of their sensitive perceptions?		
A449	we shall hardly be able to give a satisfactory answer to it		
A450	After all this, the Empress desired the Worm men to give her a true Relation how frost was made upon the Earth?		
A451	they gave, according to their Observation, this following reason		
A452	This Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chymists, the Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a temperate degree of hea		
A453	This Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chymists, the Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a temperate degree of heat.		
A454	having taken much satisfaction in several of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and Observations		
A455	commanded them to give her an account of the several Transmutations which their Art was able to produce.		
A457	The Conferences of the Chymists being finished, the Empress made an Assembly of her Galenical Physicians, her Herbalists and Anatomists; and first she enquired of her Herbalists the particular effects of several Herbs and Drugs, and whence they proceeded?		
A458	for by dissecting some, we cannot prevent the production of others; so that our pains and labour will be to no purpose, unless to satisfie the vain curiosities of inquisitive men. The Empress replied, That such dissections would be very beneficial to Experimental Philosophers		
A459	such dissections would be very beneficial to Experimental Philosophers		
A460	hen we dissect dead Animals, said they, it is for no other end, but to observe what defects and distempers they had, that we may cure the like in living ones, so that all our care and industry concerns onely the preservation of Mank		
A461	as for Improbable Truth I know not what your meaning is; for Truth is more then Improbability: nay, there is so much difference between Truth and Improbability, that I cannot conceive it possible how they can be joined together		
A462	was troubled, that so wise and knowing a people should have no more knowledg of the Divine Truth		
A463	told them of the punishments for their sins, to wit, That after this life they should be tormented in an everlasting Fire		
A464	she preached Sermons of Comfort to those that repented of their sins, and were troubled at their own wickedness: Neither did the heat of the flame in the least hinder her		
A465	she desired to know		
A466	I pray inform me		
A467	the Empress desired to be informed		
A468	she desired to be informed		
A469	Let me now desire you to inform me		
A470	the Empress desired the Spirits to inform her		
A471	the Empress desired the Spirits to tell her		
A472	the Empress being very desirous to know		
A473	desired to know		
A474	desired to be further informed		
A475	to be better satisfied, desired the Worm-men to inform her		
A476	she desir'd to know		
A477	the Empress desired to know		
A478	the Empress asked them the reason		
A479	be no world of Lives and F		
A480	Then she would fain know		
A481	It is the nature of Mankind to be inquisitive.		
A482	Natural desire of knowledg, answered the Spirits, is not blameable, so you do not go beyond what your Natural Reason can comprehend		
A483	she being desirous to know the Truth		
A484	Truth		
A486	the gift of Divine Knowledg		
A491	They will never come to an agreement, unless there be a Judg or Umpire to decide the Case		
A492	A Judg, replied the Empress, is easie to be had; but to get an Impartial Judg, is a thing so difficult, that I doubt we shall hardly find one; for there is none to be had, neither in Nature, nor in Hell, but onely from Heaven;		
A493	Truth should hear, and decide the cause.		
A494	Honesty		
A495	preferred Honesty and Prudence before you		
A496	otherwise Prudence and Honesty will be the chief and onely Moral Deities of Mortals		
A497	Beautiful Truth,		
A498	no offering is more acceptable to the Gods, then the offering of Peace		
A499	Justice		
A500	the God of Justice opposed Fortune's Malice		
A501	In short, the true cause of Fortunes Malice to this Duke is, that he would never flatter her; for I Honesty, did command him not to do it, or else he would be forced to follow all her inconstant ways, and obey all her unjust commands, which would cause a great reproach to him:		
A502	to make a Peace		
A503	just and Impartial Judgment, she had alwayes a very great esteem		
A505	he truth is, said she, wheresoever Learning is, there is most commonly also Controversie and quarelling; for there be always some that will know more, and be wiser then others: some think their Arguments come nearer to Truth, and are more rational then others		
A506	who gave her Intelligence of all such things as she desired to know		
A507	I have chosen rather to quit my own Tranquility, Riches and Pleasure, than suffer you to be ruined and destroyed.		
A508	be rewarded with the Blessings of Heaven		
A509	you may live Peaceably and Happily		
A512	and that by the hand of Justice, which was necessitated to punish their crime of stealing away a young and beauteous Lady.		
A513	to punish their crime of stealing away a young and beauteous Lady.		
A514	I esteeming Peace before Warr

A543	eminent scholars.		
A547	The present author has performed both these duties excellently.		
A550	let us permit these new hypotheses also to become known, especially since they are admirable as well as simple and bring with them a huge treasure of very skillful observations.		
A554	I am aware that a philosopher’s ideas are not subject to the judgement of ordinary persons, because it is his endeavor to seek the truth in all things, to the extent permitted to human reason by God.		
A555	I am aware that a philosopher’s ideas are not subject to the judgement of ordinary persons,		
A562	dispel the fog of absurdity by most luminous proofs.		
A565	uncertain		
A566	agreement with the phenomena.		
A569	true symmetry		
A571	false,		
A573	I was impelled to consider a different system of deducing the motions of the universe’s spheres for no other reason than the realization that astronomers do not agree among themselves in their investigations of this subject. For, in the first place, they are so uncertain about the motion of the sun and moon that they cannot establish and observe a constant length even for the tropical year. Secondly, in determining the motions not only of these bodies but also of the other five planets, they do not use the same principles, assumptions, and explanations of the apparent revolutions and motions.		
A574	by this means they were unable to obtain any incontrovertible result in absolute agreement with the phenomena.		
A579	understood with greater certainty		
A580	I undertook the task of rereading the works of all the philosophers which I could obtain to learn whether anyone had ever proposed other motions of the universe’s spheres than those expounded by the teachers of astronomy in the schools.		
A588	phenomena		
A590	acute and learned astronomers will agree with me		
A592	I do not run away from the judgement of anybody		
A596	to what extent the motions and appearances of the other planets and spheres can be saved if they are correlated with the earth’s motions.		
A597	babblers who claim to be judges of astronomy although completely ignorant of the subject		
A598	badly distorting some passage of Scripture to their purpose,		
A602	Astronomy is written for astronomers.		
A604	the most beautiful objects, most deserving to be known.		
A605	phenomena in the sky,		
A607	purity		
A608	free man,		
A611	Among the many various literary and artistic pursuits which invigorate men’s minds, the strongest affection and utmost zeal should, I think, promote the studies concerned with the most beautiful objects, most deserving to be known.		
A615	disagreement,		
A616	knowledge		
A620	An additional reason is that the motion of the planets and the revolution of the stars could not be measured with numerical precision and completely understood except with the passage of time and the aid of many earlier observations, through which this knowledge was transmitted to posterity from hand to hand, so to say.		
A622	the motion of the heavenly bodies has eluded the skill of the astronomers.		
A624	The philosopher will perhaps rather seek the semblance of the truth		
A626	Therefore with the utmost earnestness I entreat you, most learned sir, unless I inconvenience you, to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars, and at the earliest possible moment to send me your writings on the sphere of the universe together with the tables and whatever else you have that is relevant to this subject.		
A627	I must be immediately repudiated together with this belief		
A628	For I am not so enamored of my own opinions that I disregard what others may think of them		
A631	But while I hesitated for a long time and even resisted, my friends drew me back		
A633	not false		
A635	For this reason I undertook the task of rereading the works of all the philosophers which I could obtain to learn whether anyone had ever proposed other motions of the universe’s spheres than those expounded by the teachers of astronomy in the schools		
A637	I do not run away from the judgement of anybody at all,		
A638	I have no doubt that acute and learned astronomers will agree with me if, as this discipline especially requires, they are willing to examine and consider, not superficially but thoroughly, what I adduce in this volume in proof of these matters		
A643	I shall treat many topics differently from my predecessors, and yet I shall do so thanks to them, for it was they who first opened the road to the investigation of these very questions.		
A644	it is his endeavor to seek the truth in all things		
A647	raisonnements		
A650	Mais j'eus beau leur alléguer que _Pythagore_, _Epicure_, _Démocrite et de notre âge Copernic et Keppler_		
A652	raison		
A653	Mais, ajoutais-je, je ne saurais m'éclaircir de ce doute, si je ne monte jusque-là?		
A654	Prométhée fut bien autrefois au Ciel y dérober du feu. Suis-je moins hardi que lui? et ai-je lieu de n'en pas espérer un succès aussi favorable?		
A655	après avoir flatté mes rêveries de quelques moyens proportionnés à mon sujet, voici comment je montai au Ciel.		
A656	Mon bonheur fut grand de rencontrer un homme capable de hautes opinions, et qui ne s'étonna point, quand je lui dis qu'il fallait que la Terre eût tourné pendant mon élévation, puisque, ayant commencé de monter à deux lieues de Paris, j'étais tombé, par une ligne quasi-perpendiculaire, en Canada.		
A659	nous le voyons marcher?		
A660	nous la sentons ferme dessous nous?		
A661	voici les raisons à peu près qui nous obligent à le préjuger.		
A662	il est du sens commun de croire que le Soleil a pris la place au centre de l'univers,		
A674	la Nouvelle-France, où nous sommes, en produit un exemple bien convaincant		
A675	je vous ferai observer, par le moyen d'une lunette excellente, que certaines obscurités, qui d'ici paraissent des taches, sont des mondes qui se construisent.		
A678	Nous eûmes, le lendemain et les jours suivants, des entretiens de pareille nature.		
A679	Je m'en allais, dès qu'elle était levée, rêvant, parmi les bois, à la conduite et à la réussite de mon entreprise;		
A680	J'avais fait une machine que je m'imaginais capable de m'élever autant que je voudrais, en sorte que, rien de tout ce que j'y croyais nécessaire n'y manquant, je m'assis dedans, et me précipitai en l'air, du haut d'une roche.		
A681	je retombai de plus belle au dessein de monter à la Lune.		
A684	selon le calcul que j'ai fait depuis		
A694	Il y a du vulgaire, ici comme là, qui ne peut souffrir la pensée des choses où il n'est point accoutumé.		
A695	si quelqu'un de cette terre avait monté dans la vôtre, avec la hardiesse de se dire homme, vos savants le feraient étouffer comme un monstre.		
A698	le peuple de votre Terre devint si stupide et si grossier que mes compagnons et moi perdîmes tout le plaisir que nous avions autrefois pris à l'instruire.		
A699	j'ai rôdé beaucoup en Europe et conversé avec des personnes que possible vous aurez connues.		
A701	ce fut moi qui lui conseillai, pendant qu'il était à l'Inquisition dans Rome, de styler son visage et son corps aux postures ordinaires de ceux dont il avait besoin de connaître l'intérieur, afin d'exciter chez soi par une même assiette les pensées que cette même situation avait appelées dans ses adversaires, parce qu'ainsi il ménagerait mieux leur arme, quand il la connaîtrait,		
A702	le seul homme libre que vous ayez.		
A703	pourquoi je tâchai de lui faire accepter trois fioles: la première était pleine d'huile de talk, l'autre, de poudre de projection, et la dernière, d'or potable; mais il les refusa avec un dédain plus généreux que Diogène ne reçut les compliments d'Alexandre.		
A704	il est presque exempt de guerres		
A705	les hommes y sont amateurs de la vérité		
A706	qu'on n'y voit point de Pédants		
A708	Bref, en ce pays, on ne compte pour insensés que les Sophistes et les Orateurs.		
A711	J'adoucissais ainsi la dureté des mauvais traitements de mon maître par les visites que me rendait cet officieux Démon		
A713	c'est une invention tout ensemble et bien utile et bien agréable;		
A714	ses merveilleux entretiens me faisaient passer sans ennui les violences de ma captivité.		
A719	l y a très grande apparence à ce que vous dites, et je viens moi-même d'en expérimenter quelque chose;		
A720	ils ont l'industrie de mêler parmi leur poudre et leur plomb une certaine composition qui tue, plume, rôtit et assaisonne le gibier.		
A722	quand quelqu'un meurt de faim, ce n'est jamais qu'un buffle, et les personnes d'esprit font toujours grande chère.		
A727	Un jour, mon mâle (car on me prenait pour la femelle) me conta que ce qui l'avait véritablement obligé de courir toute la terre, et enfin de l'abandonner pour la Lune, était qu'il n'avait pu trouver un seul pays où l'imagination même fût en liberté.		
A737	nous philosophions, car nous n'aimions guère ni l'un ni l'autre à nous entretenir des choses basses:		
A738	nous philosophions,		
A739	Je suis bien fâché, dit-il, de voir un esprit de la trempe du vôtre infecté des erreurs du vulgaire.		
A743	car ce petit Espagnol avait l'esprit joli.		
A748	notre Justice.		
A754	Le parti qui soutenait en ma faveur		
A755	demandèrent une assemblée des Etats, pour résoudre cette controverse.		
A757	les arbitres pacifièrent l'animosité par le nombre des intéressés qu'ils égalèrent,		
A764	raison,		
A765	toute la Cour se divertissait à me faire jaser.		
A768	tout cela avec tant d'égalité qu'il n'y a pas dans une armée un seul homme plus que dans l'autre,		
A769	de l'autre côté, les géants ont en tête les colosses; les escrimeurs, les adroits; les vaillants, les courageux; les débiles, les faibles; les indisposés, les malades; les robustes, les forts; et, si quelqu'un entreprenait de frapper un autre que son ennemi désigné, à moins qu'il ne pût justifier que c'était par méprise, il est condamné comme couard. Après la bataille donnée, on compte les blessés, les morts, les prisonniers; car, pour les fuyards, il ne s'en trouve point; si les pertes se trouvent égales de part et d'autre, ils tirent à la courte paille à qui se proclamera victorieux.		
A770	il y a d'autres armées, plus nombreuses, de savants et d'hommes d'esprit, des disputes desquelles dépend entièrement le triomphe ou la servitude des Etats.  «Un savant est opposé à un autre savant, un spirituel à un autre spirituel, et un judicieux à un autre judicieux. Au reste, le triomphe que remporte un Etat en cette façon est compté pour trois victoires à force ouverte.		
A776	Pourquoi donc, continua-t-elle, ne choisissent-ils des arbitres non suspects, pour être accordés? Et, s'il se trouve qu'ils aient autant de droit l'un que l'autre, qu'ils demeurent comme ils étaient, ou qu'ils jouent en un coup de piquet la Ville ou la Province dont ils sont en dispute?		
A778	Croiriez-vous, par votre foi, ayant vaincu sur le pré votre ennemi seul à seul, l'avoir vaincu de bonne guerre, si vous étiez maillé, et lui, non; s'il n'avait qu'un poignard, et vous une estocade; enfin s'il était manchot, et que vous eussiez deux bras? Cependant, avec toute l'égalité que vous recommandez, tant à vos gladiateurs, ils ne se battent jamais pareils; car l'un sera de grande, l'autre, de petite taille; l'un sera adroit, l'autre n'aura jamais manié d'épée; l'un sera robuste, l'autre faible; et, quand même ces disproportions seraient égales, qu'ils seraient aussi adroits et aussi forts l'un que l'autre, encore ne seraient-ils pas pareils, car l'un des deux aura peut-être plus de courage que l'autre; et, sous l'ombre que cet emporté ne considérera pas le péril, qu'il sera bilieux, qu'il aura plus de sang, qu'il avait le cœur plus serré, avec toutes ces qualités qui font le courage, comme si ce n'était pas, aussi bien qu'une épée, une arme que son ennemi n'a point, il s'ingère de se ruer éperdument sur lui, de l'effrayer, et d'ôter la vie à ce pauvre homme, qui prévoit le danger, dont la chaleur est étouffée dans la pituite, et duquel le cœur est trop vaste pour unir les esprits nécessaires à dissiper cette glace qu'on appelle _poltronnerie_. Ainsi vous louez cet homme d'avoir tué son ennemi avec avantage, et, le louant de hardiesse, vous le louez d'un péché contre nature, puisque sa hardiesse tend à la destruction.		
A779	avoir bien égalé les avantages de deux ennemis, quand vous les avez choisis tous deux grands, tous deux adroits, tous deux pleins de courage; mais ce n'est pas encore assez, puisqu'il faut qu'enfin le vainqueur surmonte par adresse, par force, et par fortune.		
A792	Pour cet effet, ils furent en corps faire leur plainte au Roi, qui leur promit justice, et ordonna que je serais remis sur la sellette.		
A793	qui leur promit justice, et ordonna que je serais remis sur la sellette.		
A798	s'il est homme, quand même il ne serait pas venu de la Lune, puisque tout homme est libre, ne lui est-il pas libre aussi de s'imaginer ce qu'il voudra?		
A804	supposé qu'il soit animal sans raison, en auriez-vous vous-mêmes de l'accuser d'avoir péché contre elle?		
A805	De croire que cette savante Nature qui a fait le Monde et la Lune ne sache ce que c'est elle-même, et que vous autres, qui n'avez de connaissance que ce que vous en tenez d'elle, le sachiez plus certainement, cela serait bien ridicule.		
A806	qui n'avez de connaissance que ce que vous en tenez d'elle,		
A807	il faut qu'il se présente à son imagination certaines possibilités plus grandes au _oui_ qu'au _non_;		
A808	Mais, quand même la passion vous ferait renoncer à vos principes, et que vous supposeriez que la Nature ne guidât pas les bêtes, rougissez à tout le moins des inquiétudes que vous causent les caprices d'une bête.		
A809	En vérité, Messieurs, si vous rencontriez un homme d'âge mûr, qui veillât à la police d'une fourmilière, pour tantôt donner un soufflet à la fourmi qui aurait fait choir sa compagne, tantôt en emprisonner une qui aurait dérobé à sa voisine un grain de blé, tantôt mettre en justice une autre qui aurait abandonné ses œufs, ne l'estimeriez-vous pas insensé de vaquer à des choses trop au-dessous de lui, et de prétendre assujettir à la raison des animaux qui n'en ont pas l'usage? Comment donc, vénérable assemblée, défendrez-vous l'intérêt que vous prenez aux caprices de ce petit animal? Justes, j'ai dit.»		
A810	le Roi prononça:  «Que dorénavant je serais censé homme, comme tel mis en liberté,		
A814	je n'eusse publié dans les compagnies la vigueur et la force de votre esprit,		
A815	La fin de mes remerciements nous vit entrer chez lui;		
A816	il m'entretint, jusqu'au repas, des ressorts qu'il avait fait jouer pour obliger mes ennemis, malgré tous les plus spécieux scrupules dont ils avaient embabouiné le Peuple, à se déporter d'une poursuite si injuste.		
A817	il m'entretint, jusqu'au repas, des ressorts qu'il avait fait jouer		
A820	elle ne répugne point à la droite raison;		
A822	n'est-il pas plus capable de gouverner une famille, qu'un infirme sexagénaire, pauvre hébété, dont la neige de soixante hivers a glacé l'imagination,		
A827	Je ne suis pas si surpris, répliquai-je, qu'il s'abstienne de la chair, et de toutes choses qui ont eu vie sensitive; car, en notre Monde, les Pythagoriciens, et même quelques saints anachorètes, ont usé de ce régime; mais de n'oser, par exemple, couper un chou, de peur de le blesser, cela me semble tout à fait ridicule.  --Et moi, répondit mon Démon, je trouve beaucoup d'apparence en son opinion. Car, dites-moi, ce chou dont vous parlez n'est-il pas comme vous un être existant de la Nature?		
A828	Si on dit que nous sommes faits à l'image du premier Etre, et non pas le chou? Quand il serait vrai, nous avons, en souillant notre âme, par où nous lui ressemblons, effacé cette ressemblance, puisqu'il n'y a rien de plus contraire à Dieu que le péché.		
A829	Le péché de massacrer un homme n'est pas si grand, parce qu'un jour il revivra, que de couper un chou et lui ôter la vie, à lui qui n'en a point d'autre à espérer.		
A830	Il est vrai que nous naquîmes les premiers; mais, dans la famille de Dieu, il n'y a point de droit d'aînesse:		
A831	si donc les choux n'eurent point de part avec nous du fief de l'immortalité, ils furent sans doute avantagés de quelque autre qui, par sa grandeur, récompensât sa brièveté; c'est peut-être un intellect universel, une connaissance parfaite de toutes les choses dans leurs causes;		
A832	Souvenez-vous donc, ô de tous les animaux le plus superbe! qu'encore qu'un chou que vous coupez ne dise mot, il n'en pense pas moins.		
A833	le pauvre végétant n'a pas des organes propres à hurler comme vous; il n'en a pas pour frétiller ni pour pleurer; il en a toutefois, par lesquels il se plaint du tort que vous lui faites, et par lesquels il attire sur vous la vengeance du Ciel.		
A834	il en a toutefois, par lesquels il se plaint du tort que vous lui faites, et par lesquels il attire sur vous la vengeance du Ciel.		
A838	Lorsqu'elle fut apportée, il la saisit par le bras, et la fouetta un gros quart d'heure.  --Or sus! vaurien, continua-t-il, en punition de votre désobéissance, je veux que vous serviez aujourd'hui de risée à tout le monde, et, pour cet effet, je vous commande de ne marcher que sur deux pieds le reste de la journée.		
A839	les mobiles, comme par exemple celle où nous sommes maintenant, sont faites comme je vais vous dire. L'architecte construit chaque Palais, ainsi que vous voyez, d'un bois fort léger; il pratique dessous quatre roues; dans l'épaisseur de l'un des murs, il place dix gros soufflets, dont les tuyaux passent, d'une ligne horizontale, à travers le dernier étage, de l'un à l'autre pignon, en sorte que, quand on veut traîner les Villes autre part (car on les change d'air à toutes les saisons), chacun déplie sur l'un des côtés de son logis quantité de larges voiles au-devant des soufflets; puis, ayant bandé un ressort pour les faire jouer, leurs maisons, en moins de huit jours, avec les bouffées continuelles que vomissent ces monstres à vent, sont emportées, si on veut, à plus de cent lieues.		
A841	Ainsi, je lui ai promis d'aider son dessein de toutes mes forces, et d'inventer, pour cet effet, une machine capable de tenir trois ou quatre personnes, dans laquelle vous pourrez monter ensemble dès aujourd'hui		
A842	Je vais m'appliquer sérieusement à l'exécution de cette entreprise:		
A846	Maintenant, afin que vous sachiez pourquoi en ce pays tout le monde a le nez grand, apprenez qu'aussitôt que la femme est accouchée, la matrone porte l'enfant au maître du Séminaire; et justement, au bout de l'an, les experts étant assemblés, si son nez est trouvé plus court qu'à une certaine mesure que tient le Syndic, il est censé camus et mis entre les mains de gens qui le châtrent. Vous me demanderez la cause de cette barbarie, et comment il peut se faire que nous, chez qui la virginité est un crime, établissons des continences par force? Mais sachez que nous le faisons après avoir observé, depuis trente siècles, qu'un grand nez est le signe d'un homme spirituel, courtois, affable, généreux, libéral; et que le petit est un signe du contraire. C'est pourquoi des Camus on bâtit les Eunuques, parce que la République aime mieux ne pas avoir d'enfants que d'en avoir qui leur fussent semblables.		
A848	O mon petit homme! s'écria-t-il, quoi! les grands de votre Monde sont si enragés de faire parade d'un grand instrument qui désigne un bourreau, qui n'est forgé que pour nous détruire, enfin l'ennemi juré de tout ce qui vit;		
A851	Il s'en alla ensuite et me laissa dans l'admiration des gens de ce Monde-là, dans lesquels, jusqu'au simple peuple, il se trouve naturellement tant d'esprit, au lieu que ceux du nôtre en ont si peu, et qui leur coûte si cher.		
A853	_Pour me purger de ce mauvais air, je m'exposais tout nu au soleil dessus une terrasse,		
A856	Mais j'eus beau leur alléguer que _Pythagore_, _Epicure_, _Démocrite et de notre âge Copernic et Keppler_[4] avaient été de cette opinion		
A858	J'avais attaché autour de moi quantité de fioles pleines de rosée, sur lesquelles le Soleil dardait ses rayons si violemment, que la chaleur, qui les attirait, comme elle fait les plus grosses nuées, m'éleva si haut, qu'enfin je me trouvai au-dessus de la moyenne région		
A859	je lui dis qu'il fallait que la Terre eût tourné pendant mon élévation, puisque, ayant commencé de monter à deux lieues de Paris, j'étais tombé, par une ligne quasi-perpendiculaire, en Canada.		
A860	je lui dis qu'il fallait que la Terre eût tourné pendant mon élévation, puisque, ayant commencé de monter à deux lieues de Paris, j'étais tombé, par une ligne quasi-perpendiculaire, en Canada		
A861	je vous dirai franchement que ce qui fait que je ne suis pas de votre opinion, c'est qu'encore qu'hier vous soyez parti de Paris, vous pouvez être arrivé aujourd'hui en cette contrée, sans que la Terre ait tourné		
A862	je vous dirai franchement que ce qui fait que je ne suis pas de votre opinion		
A866	les raisons qu'allègue Copernic		
A871	m'obliger de vous confesser que mon raisonnement le   cédera toujours en ces sortes de choses à la Foi.		
A872	Nous eûmes, le lendemain et les jours suivants, des entretiens de pareille nature		
A873	J'avais fait une machine que je m'imaginais capable de m'élever autant que je voudrais,		
A876	et je me confirmai dans cette opinion,		
A877	J'ai souvent fait depuis réflexion sur ce que le vulgaire assure qu'en se précipitant d'un lieu fort haut, on est étouffé avant de toucher la terre; et j'ai conclu, de mon aventure, qu'il en avait menti		
A878	ce que vous dites est véritable; cette terre-ci est la Lune, que vous voyez de votre globe		
A880	mes compagnons et moi perdîmes tout le plaisir que nous avions autrefois pris à l'instruire.		
A881	conversé avec des personnes		
A882	j'ai enseigné quantité de souplesses et de secrets naturels, qui sans doute les auront fait passer pour de Grands Magiciens		
A883	mais il les refusa avec un dédain plus généreux que Diogène ne reçut les compliments d'Alexandre		
A884	le seul homme libre		
A887	il y a dans l'univers un million peut-être de choses, qui, pour être connues, demanderaient en vous un million d'organes tous différents		
A888	me faisaient passer sans ennui les violences de ma captivité.		
A889	je viens moi-même d'en expérimenter quelque chose		
A890	la police judicieuse de ce pays-là,		
A891	notre entretien était un grognement que la joie d'être rejoints, par un instinct naturel, nous faisait bourdonner.		
A893	liberté		
A895	car nous n'aimions guère ni l'un ni l'autre à nous entretenir des choses basses		
A896	ceux qui tenaient pour moi demandèrent une assemblée des Etats, pour résoudre cette controverse.		
A897	et encore devait-il les prouver au moins plus raisonnables que ceux des autres Sectes dont vous nous avez parlé. C'est pourquoi le bon seigneur ne trouvera pas mauvais si nous lui baisons les mains.		
A899	égalité		
A900	Un savant est opposé à un autre savant, un spirituel à un autre spirituel, et un judicieux à un autre judicieux. Au reste, le triomphe que remporte un Etat en cette façon est compté pour trois victoires à force ouverte.		
A904	justice de leur cause		
A905	avec toute l'égalité que vous recommandez		
A906	Vous vous imaginez, Messieurs, avoir bien égalé les avantages de deux ennemis, quand vous les avez choisis tous deux grands, tous deux adroits, tous deux pleins de courage		
A908	elles me semblèrent ingénieuses		
A909	j'eusse trouvé sa Philosophie beaucoup plus raisonnable que la nôtre		
A912	j'avais osé dire que la Lune d'où je venais était un Monde, et que leur Monde n'était qu'une Lune, crurent que cela leur fournissait un prétexte assez juste pour me faire condamner à l'eau: c'est la façon d'exterminer les impies.		
A915	puisque tout homme est libre		
A920	punition d'être noyé serait modifiée en une amende honteuse		
A921	m'obligèrent de prononcer		
A922	Vous vous étonnez, continua-t-il, d'une coutume si contraire à celle de votre pays? Mais elle ne répugne point à la droite raison		
A924	ce vieillard est mon père et le Ciel me promet une longue vie si je l'honore		
A926	ce chou dont vous parlez n'est-il pas comme vous un être existant de la Nature?		
A927	la vengeance du Ciel.		
A928	Souvenez-vous donc, ô de tous les animaux le plus superbe! qu'encore qu'un chou que vous coupez ne dise mot, il n'en pense pas moins. Mais le pauvre végétant n'a pas des organes propres à hurler comme vous; il n'en a pas pour frétiller ni pour pleurer;		
A929	Il me reste à prouver qu'il y a des Mondes infinis dans un Monde infini.		
A930	Lorsqu'elle fut apportée, il la saisit par le bras, et la fouetta un gros quart d'heure		
A931	en punition de votre désobéissance, je veux que vous serviez aujourd'hui de risée à tout le monde, et, pour cet effet, je vous commande de ne marcher que sur deux pieds le reste de la journée.		
A932	Mais, me direz-vous, comment le hasard peut-il avoir ramassé en un lieu toutes les choses nécessaires à produire ce chêne?		
A933	Vous me demanderez comment il se peut faire que j'aperçoive si loin de moi une chose que je ne vois point?		
A935	pitié		
A936	d'inventer, pour cet effet, une machine capable de tenir trois ou quatre personnes, dans laquelle vous pourrez monter ensemble dès aujourd'hui		
A938	les vérités de chaque contradictoire		
A940	sans aucune raison captieuse ou sophistique		
A942	des gens de ce Monde-là, dans lesquels, jusqu'au simple peuple, il se trouve naturellement tant d'esprit, au lieu que ceux du nôtre en ont si peu, et qui leur coûte si cher.		
A943	Il y avoit longtemps que nous ne parlions plus des mondes, Madame L.M.D.G. et moi,		
A944	j’allai un jour chez elle, et y entrai justement comme deux hommes d’esprit		
A947	moi, avec toute la naïveté possible, je lui ai soutenu que je le croyois		
A949	il a toujours pris cela pour une feinte d’une personne qui vouloit se divertir, et j’ai cru que ce qui le rendoit si opiniâtre à ne me pas croire moi même sur mes sentimens, c’est qu’il m’estimoit trop pour s’imaginer que je fusse capable d’une opinion si extravagante.		
A950	il m’estimoit trop pour s’imaginer que je fusse capable d’une opinion si extravagante.		
A955	Ils ont bien de l’esprit, répliquai-je, mais ils ne raisonnent jamais.		
A956	Les raisonneurs, qui sont gens durs, les appelleront peuple sans difficulté.		
A959	Trahir la vérité ! dit la Marquise. Vous n’avez point de conscience.		
A962	La raison a beau venir nous dire qu’il y a dans les planètes des campagnes, des prairies, la raison vient trop tard,		
A963	le premier coup d’œil a fait son effet sur nous avant elle,		
A965	Voudriez-vous que pour établir les habitants des planètes, dont les intérêts me touchent d’assez loin, j’allasse attaquer ces redoutables puissances qu’on appelle les sens et l’imagination ?		
A970	vous ne sauriez imaginer le moindre sujet de doute, si vous ne reprenez les yeux et l’esprit du peuple.		
A974	Les horloges les plus communes et les plus grossières marquent les heures, il n’y a que celles qui sont travaillées avec plus d’art qui marquent les minutes.		
A979	Mais qu’ils aient réellement cette révolution de vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre, c’est bien la chose du monde où il y a le moins d’apparence, quoique l’absurdité n’en saute pas d’abord aux yeux.		
A981	Je vous entends, interrompit la Marquise, et je crois que vous avez raison. Oui, je suis de votre avis ; si les planètes tournoient autour de la Terre, elles tourneroient en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances, ainsi qu’elles font autour du Soleil ; n’est-ce pas ce que vous voulez dire ?		
A983	et les étoiles fixes, qui sont si prodigieusement éloignées de nous, si fort élevées au-dessus de tout ce qui pourroit prendre autour de nous un mouvement général, du moins situées en lieu où ce mouvement devroit être fort affaibli, n’y aurait-il pas bien de l’apparence qu’elles ne tourneroient pas autour de nous en vingt-quatre heures,		
A984	Les comètes, qui sont étrangères dans notre tourbillon, qui y tiennent des routes si différentes, ne devraient-elles pas être dispensées de tourner toutes autour de nous dans ce même temps de vingt-quatre heures ? Mais non, planètes, étoiles fixes, comètes, tout tournera en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre. Encore, s’il y avait dans ces mouvemens quelques minutes de différence, on pourroit s’en contenter ; mais ils seront tous de la plus exacte égalité, ou plutôt de la seule égalité exacte qui soit au monde ; pas une minute de plus ou de moins. En vérité, cela doit être étrangement suspect.		
A986	Et nos pendules ne marquent-elles pas une entière égalité ? Oh ! répondis-je, je récuse les pendules ; elles ne peuvent pas elles-mêmes être tout à fait justes, et quelquefois qu’elles le seront, en marquant qu’un tour de vingt-quatre heures sera plus long ou plus court qu’un autre, on aimera mieux les croire déréglées que de soupçonner la Terre de quelque irrégularité dans ses révolutions.		
A991	qui marquent nécessairement que l’eau les a autrefois couvertes.		
A995	ous ces changemens, qui ne sont sensibles qu’à nos meilleures lunettes,		
A996	Mais enfin depuis trente ans on l’a démêlée sûrement, et elle a fait quelque temps les délices des astronomes, dont la curiosité avoit besoin d’être réveillée par quelque chose d’une espèce nouvelle		
A997	les deux dernières lunes de Saturne, par exemple, ne les ont pas charmés ni ravis, comme avoient fait les satellites ou les lunes de Jupiter ; on s’accoutume à tout.		
A999	Je croirois assez volontiers que la nature, selon le penchant que je lui connois à l’économie, ne se seroit servie que de ce seul moyen. Cependant, répliquai-je, malgré cette économie, il y auroit à l’égard de notre Terre deux causes de crépuscules, dont l’une, qui est l’air épais du Soleil, seroit assez inutile,		
A1000	ne pourroit être qu’un objet de curiosité pour les habitants de l’observatoire		
A1003	Voilà, Madame, répondis-je, un petit commencement de système que vous avez fait assez heureusement.		
A1005	En fait des découvertes nouvelles, il ne se faut pas trop presser de raisonner, quoiqu’on en ait toujours assez d’envie, et les vrais philosophes sont comme les éléphants, qui en marchant ne posent jamais le second pied à terre, que le premier n’y soit bien affermi.		
A1006	Je viens de vous dire, répondis-je, toutes les nouvelles que je sais du ciel, et je ne crois pas qu’il y en ait de plus fraîches. Je suis bien fâché qu’elles ne soient pas aussi sur prenantes et aussi merveilleuses que quelques observations que je lisois l’autre jour dans un abrégé des Annales de la Chine, écrit en latin.		
A1007	Je suis bien fâché qu’elles ne soient pas aussi sur prenantes et aussi merveilleuses que quelques observations que je lisois l’autre jour dans un abrégé des Annales de la Chine, écrit en latin.		
A1008	Cela n’a pas été vu pour une fois à la Chine,		
A1009	j’ai trouvé cette observation en deux temps assez éloignés,		
A1010	Il n’y a pas longtemps que tous nos philosophes se croyoient fondés en expérience pour soutenir que les cieux et tous les corps célestes étoient incorruptibles, et incapables de changement, et pendant ce temps-là d’autres hommes à l’autre bout de la Terre voyoient des étoiles se dissoudre par milliers, cela est assez différent.		
A1013	Trahir la vérité		
A1014	Vous n’avez point de conscience.		
A1015	Je vous avoue, répondis-je, que je n’ai pas un grand zèle pour ces vérités-là		
A1016	on ne persuade pas facilement aux hommes de mettre leur raison en la place de leurs yeux		
A1017	Les horloges les plus communes et les plus grossières marquent les heures, il n’y a que celles qui sont travaillées avec plus d’art qui marquent les minutes. De même les esprits ordinaires sentent bien la différence d’une simple vraisemblance à une certitude entière ; mais il n’y a que les esprits fins qui sentent le plus ou le moins de certitude ou de vraisemblance, et qui en marquent, pour ainsi dire, les minutes par leur sentiment.		
A1020	La raison a beau venir nous dire qu’il y a dans les planètes des campagnes, des prairies, la raison vient trop tard, le premier coup d’œil a fait son effet sur nous avant elle, nous ne la voulons plus écouter, les planètes ne sont que des corps lumineux		
A1024	ils ne sont pas tout à fait certains, ils sont plus que vraisemblables, cela m’embarrasse trop		
A1034	Je vous entends, interrompit la Marquise, et je crois que vous avez raison.		
A1035	récompense		
A1036	j’entends quelque visage à la manière de la Lune, car chacun transporte sur les objets les idées dont il est rempli		
A1037	Il y a beaucoup d’apparence, répondis-je, qu’il en est arrivé.		
A1043	Sur ce pied-là, je dois me dédire de ce que je vous avois dit, que la Lune ne devoit point avoir de crépuscules, faute d’être environnée d’un air épais ainsi que la Terre		
A1044	l’une, qui est l’air épais du Soleil, seroit assez inutile, et ne pourroit être qu’un objet de curiosité pour les habitants de l’observatoire		
A1046	Ils auroient tort, dit la Marquise, on n’est pas à mépriser pour être enveloppé d’un air épais, puisque le Soleil lui-même en a un qui l’enveloppe		
A1049	Ce sont celles-là, Madame, auxquelles il vous appartient de vous occuper, et qui doivent composer toute votre philosophie.		
A1050	Io scopersi pochi anni a dietro, come ben sa l’Altezza Vostra Serenissima, molti particolari nel cielo, stati invisibili sino a questa età		
A1052	quasi che io di mia mano avessi tali cose collocate in cielo, per intorbidar la natura e le scienze.		
A1053	E scordatisi in certo modo che la moltitudine de’ veri concorre all’investigazione, accrescimento e stabilimento delle discipline, e non alla diminuzione o destruzione,		
A1054	dimostrandosi nell’istesso tempo più affezionati alle proprie opinioni che alle vere,		
A1058	conclusione naturale attenente a i corpi celesti,		
A1060	È accaduto poi che il tempo è andato successivamente scoprendo a tutti le verità prima da me additate,		
A1061	e con la verità del fatto		
A1063	come i più intendenti della scienza astronomica e della naturale restarono persuasi al mio primo avviso,		
A1064	così si sono andati quietando di grado in grado gli altri tutti che non venivano mantenuti in negativa o in dubbio da altro che dall’inaspettata novità e dal non aver avuta occasione di vederne sensate esperienze		
A1079	questa riforma, la quale allora rimase imperfetta solo perché non si aveva ancora esatta cognizione della giusta misura dell’anno e del mese lunare:		
A1080	a lui fu dato carico dal Vescovo Semproniense, allora soprintendente a ques’impresa, di cercar con replicati studi e fatiche di venire in maggior lume e certezza di essi movimenti celesti; ond’egli, con fatiche veramente atlantiche e col suo mirabil ingegno, rimessosi a tale studio, si avanzò tanto in queste scienze, e a tale esattezza ridusse la notizia de’ periodi de’ movimenti celesti, che si guadagnò il titolo di sommo astronomo, e conforme alla sua dottrina non solamente si è poi regolato il calendario, ma si fabbricorno le tavole di tutti i movimenti de’ pianeti		
A1082	La quale ora mentre si va scoprendo quanto ella sia ben fondata sopra ben manifeste esperienze e necessarie dimostrazioni,		
A1084	manifeste esperienze		
A1089	per dichiararla non pur falsa, ma eretica,		
A1091	con quanto più pio e religioso zelo procedo io		
A1092	propongo non che non si danni questo libro, ma che non si danni, come vorrebbono essi, senza intenderlo, ascoltarlo, né pur vederlo,		
A1095	fondate prima sopra sensate esperienze ed accuratissime osservazioni.		
A1104	però protestandomi (e anco credo che la sincerità mia si farà per se stessa manifesta)		
A1106	mi dichiaro ancora non voler nell’istesse materie ingaggiar lite con nissuno		
A1107	mi dichiaro ancora non voler nell’istesse materie ingaggiar lite con nissuno, ancor che fossero punti		
A1110	ben che molte delle cose che io noto le abbia sentite con i proprii orecchi, liberamente ammetto e concedo a chi l’ha dette che dette non l’abbia, se così gli piace, confessando poter essere ch’io abbia frainteso; e però quando rispondo non sia detto per loro, ma per chi avesse quella opinione		
A1119	sensate esperienze		
A1137	sensate esperienze,		
A1142	chi vuol por termine alli umani ingegni? Chi vorrà asserire, già essersi veduto e saputo tutto quello che è al mondo di sensibile e di scibile?		
A1147	disordine veramente sarebbe l’aggiugnergli a richiesta di persone, le quali, oltre che noi ignoriamo se parlino inspirate da celeste virtù, chiaramente vediamo che in esse si potrebbe desiderare quella intelligenza che sarebbe necessaria prima a capire, e poi a redarguire, le dimostrazioni con le quali le acutissime scienze procedono nel confermare simili conclusioni.		
A1159	Però grazie infinite doviamo render a Dio benedetto, il quale per sua benignità ci spoglia di questo timore, mentre spoglia d’autorità simil sorte di persone, riponendo il consultare, risolvere e decretare sopra determinazioni tanto importanti nella somma sapienza e bontà di prudentissimi padri e nella suprema autorità di quelli, che, scorti dallo Spirito Sabnto non possono se non santamente ordinare, permettendo che della leggerezza di quelli altri non sia fatto stima. Questa sorte d’uomini, per mio credere, son quelli contro i quali, non senza ragione, si riscaldano i gravi e santi scrittori, e de i quali in particolare scrive San Girolamo: «Hanc» (intendendo della Scrittura Sacra) «garrula anus, hanc delirus senex, hanc sophista verbosus, hanc universi præsumunt, lacerant, docent antequam discant. Alii, adducto supercilio, grandia verba trutinantes, inter mulierculas de Sacris Literis philosophantur; alii discunt, proh pudor, a fæminis quod viros doceant, et, ne parum hoc sit, quadam facilitate verborum, imo audacia, edisserunt aliis quod ipsi non intelligunt. Taceo de mei similibus, qui, si forte ad Scriputras Sanctas post seculares literas venerint, et sermone composito aurem populi mulserint, quidquid dixerint, hoc legem Dei putant, nec scire dignantur quid Prophetæ quid Apostoli senserint, sed ad sensum suum incongrua aptant testimonia; quasi grande sit, et non vitiosissimum docendi genus, depravare sententias, et ad voluntatem suam Scripturam trahere repugnantem.»		
A1160	Io non voglio metter nel numero di simili scrittori secolari alcuni teologi, riputati da me per uomini di profonda dottrina e di santissimi costumi, e per ciò tenuti in grande stima e venerazione		
A1165	quando nell’inferiore scienza si avesse alcuna conlusione per sicura, in vigor di dimostrazioni o di esperienze,		
A1168	Imperò che ella potrebbe esser tale, o vero perché quello che da tutte l’altre scienze viene insegnato, si trovasse compreso e dimostrato in lei, ma con mezi più eccellenti e con più sublime dottrina, nel modo che, per essempio, le regole del misurare i campi e del conteggiare molto più eminentemente si contengono nell’aritmetica e geometria d’Euclide, che nelle pratiche degli agrimensori e de’ computisti		
A1172	non con, l’istessa facilità si possono mutare le conclusioni dimostrate circa le cose della natura e del cielo, che le opinioni circa a quello che sia lecito o no in un contratto, in un censo, in un cambio		
A1176	in questo particolare accadrà che i seguaci di questa opinione, quanto più andran rivolgendo le carte, esaminando le ragioni, replicando l’osservazione e riscontrando l’esperienze, tanto più si confermino in questa credenza		
A1180	e più, vietar a gli uomini guardare verso il cielo		
A1182	Ma il proibire il Copernico, ora che per molte nuove osservazioni e per l’applicazione di molti literati alla sua lettura si va di giorno in giorno scoprendo più vera la sua posizione e ferma la sua dottrina, avendol’ammesso per tanti anni mentre egli era men seguito e confermato, parrebbe, a mio giudizio, un contravvenire alla verità, e cercar tanto più di occultarla e supprimerla, quanto più ella si dimostra palese e chiara		
A1190	Ma quanto alle altre, io crederei, come di sopra si è detto, che prima fosse d’accertarsi del fatto, il quale ci scorgerebbe al ritrovamento de’ veri sensi delle Scritture, li quali assolutamente si troverebbero concordi col fatto dimostrato, ben che le parole nel primo aspetto sonassero altramente; poi che due veri non possono mai contrariarsi.		
A1212	li quali, ascoltate prima l’esperienze, l’osservazioni, le ragioni e le dimostrazioni de’ filosofi ed astronomi per l’una e per l’altra parte, poi che la controversia è di problemi naturali e di dilemmi necessarii ed impossibili ad essere altramente che in una delle due maniere controverse,		
A1223	se questi tali veramente stimano e interamente credono d’avere il vero sentimento di un tal luogo particolare della Scrittura, bisogna, per necessaria conseguenza, che si tenghino anco sicuri d’aver in mano l’assoluta verità di quella conclusione naturale che intendono di disputare, e che insieme conoschino d’aver grandissimo vantaggio sopra l’avversario, a cui tocca a difender la parte falsa; essendo che quello che sostiene il vero, può aver molte esperienze sensate e molte dimostrazioni necessarie per la parte sua, mentre che l’avversario non può valersi d’altro che d’ingannevoli apparenze, di paralogismi e di fallacie.		
A1225	Però, quando volessero procedere con sincerità, doverebbono o, tacendo, confessarsi inabili a poter trattar di simili materie,		
A1230	Però par che miglior consiglio sia l’assicurarsi prima della necessaria ed immutabil verità del fatto, sopra la quale nissuno ha imperio,		
A1243	la moltitudine de’ veri concorre all’investigazione, accrescimento e stabilimento delle discipline,		
A1246	veritas		
A1250	vere		
A1251	novità, delle quali il senso istesso, quando avessero voluto con attenzione riguardarle, gli averebbe potuti render sicuri

A1255	la verità del fatto		
A1260	ragioni		
A1261	tal posizione vo confermando non solo col reprovar le ragioni di Tolommeo e d’Aristotile, ma col produrne molte in contrario

A1267	argioni		
A1271	tanto stimato, che, trattandosi nel Concilio lateranense, sotto Leon X, della emendazion del calendario ecclesiastico, egli fu chiamato a Roma sin dall’ultime parti di Germania per questa riforma,

A1443	I consulted how to join a Number of them together, so as to carry a heavier Weight, which if I could compass, I might enable a Man to be carried safely in the Air from one Place to another. I puzzled my Wits extremely with this Thought,		
A1444	and upon Trial found		
A1445	I contrived at last a Way whereby each might rise with only his own Proportion of Weight;		
A1446	I added two or three Birds more, and made Trial of their carrying a Lamb		
A1447	I much envied, that he should be the first living Creature to partake of such an excellent Device.		
A1448	At length after divers Trials

A1464	O Reader prick up thy Ears, and prepare thyself to hear the strangest Chance that ever happened to any Mortal, and which I know thou wilt not have the Grace to believe till thou seest the like Experiment, which I doubt not in a short Time may be performed		
A1468	experimentally		
A1471	I found then by Experience		
A1476	If I would follow their Directions, I should not only be carried safe Home, but be assured to command at all Times all the Pleasures of that Place		
A1477	they readily brought me very good Flesh and Fish of several Sorts, and well dressed, but that it was extreme fresh without any Relish of Salt. Wines likewise I tasted of divers Kinds as good as any in Spain, and Beer no better in all Antwerp		
A1484	the Reason whereof seems to be, that whereas the Earth according to his natural Motion (for such a Motion I am now satisfied she hath according to the Opinion of Copernicus) turns round upon her own Axis every four and twenty Hours from West to East		
A1486	the Reason whereof seems to be		
A1487	so that it seemed to me no other than an huge mathematical Globe turned round leisurely before me		
A1488	this was all the Means I now had to number the Days, and reckon the Time		
A1491	O incredible Supposition		
A1494	which these Eyes of mine can testify to be true		
A1495	testify to be true		
A1497	He that reads the Discourses of learned Men		
A1498	and adds thereto this Experience of mine		
A1505	mine Eyes have sufficiently informed me there is no such Thing		
A1507	my Reckoning it seemed to be (as indeed it was) Tuesday, September 11, at which Time the Moon being two Days old was in the twentieth Degree of Libra		
A1508	many wonderful Things were presented to my Sight		
A1511	the rest came and kindly embraced me		
A1517	I found Learning was in great Esteem among them		
A1518	they seem to detest Lying and Falshood		
A1519	which is there severely punished		
A1521	that the Globe of the Moon has likewise an attractive Power, yet so much weaker than the Earth, that if a Man do but spring upward with all his Strength, as Dancers do in shewing their Tricks, he will be able to mount fifty or sixty Foot high; and being then above all Attraction from the Moon's Earth, he falls down no more, but by the Help of these Fans, as with Wings, they convey themselves in the Air in a short Space, (though not quite so swift as Birds) whither they please		
A1522	By the Stateliness of his Palace, and the Reverence done him, I soon perceived his Greatness, and managed my Affairs in order to procure his Favour accordingly		
A1524	taking out my Jewels, I presented to the King seven Stones of several Sorts, a Diamond, a Ruby, an Emerald, a Saphire, a Topaz and an Opal		
A1526	Then I offered the Queen and Prince some others		
A1527	He then embraced me with much Endearedness		
A1528	enquired divers Things by Signs, which I answered in the same manner to the best of my Skill		
A1529	he delivered me to the Guard of 100 of his Giants as I may well call them, strictly charging them, that I should want nothing fit for me; that they should suffer none of the Dwarf Lunars, or little Moon Men, to come near me		
A1530	That I should be instructed in their Language		
A1532	I answered as near the Truth as possible		
A1533	I was provided with all Necessaries as my Heart could wish, so that I seemed to be in a Paradise		
A1536	You must understand, that of the true Lunars or Moon Men there are three Kinds		
A1538	I then applied myself to learning the Language		
A1540	Their Language is very difficult, since it hath no Affinity with any other I ever heard, and consists not so much of Words and Letters, as Tunes and strange Sounds which no Letters can express, for there are few Words but signify several Things, and are distinguished only by their Sounds, which are sung as it were in uttering; yea many Words consist of Tunes only, without Words		
A1541	Notwithstanding these Difficulties, within two Months I attained to such Knowledge therein		
A1544	I presented him the Remainder of my Jewels		
A1547	Gifts of a far more considerable Value		
A1548	The Gifts he bestowed on me were such, that a Man would part with Mountains of Gold to purchase		
A1549	this hath been the direct Opinion of divers antient, and some modern Mathematicians, and may probably be deduced from the Tenets of others, neither does it contradict any Principle of Reason nor Faith		
A1550	Knowledge		
A1552	his Covetousness had like to have been my utter Ruin		
A1553	and give perfect Instructions how those almost incredible and impossible Acquirements may be imparted to the World.		
A1557	and so by hiding and shewing my Light according to the Agreement betwixt us, I certified him of what I pleased. In the Day I advertised him by Smoke, Dust, and other refined Ways.

A1568	the wise women presented the child with their magic gifts

A1571	"""In the princess's fifteenth year she shall prick herself with a spindle and fall over dead."""		
A1577	The wise women's gifts were all fulfilled on the girl, for she was so beautiful, well behaved, friendly, and intelligent that everyone who saw her had to love her.		
A1578	"""What is that thing that is so merrily bouncing about?"" asked the girl, taking hold of the spindle, for she too wanted to spin."		
A1583	there was a sweet little girl.		
A1584	Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet.		
A1586	Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well.		
A1587	She is sick and weak, and they will do her we		
A1589	She did not know what a wicked animal he was,		
A1590	"""Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should be good for her and give her strength."""		
A1591	"We baked yesterday, and they should be good for her and give her strength."""		
A1592	"""Now that sweet young thing is a tasty bite for me."		
A1594	f a take a fresh bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased. Anyway, it is still early, and I'll be home on time		
A1595	Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods.		
A1603	"""All the better to eat you with!"""		
A1605	"A huntsman was just passing by. He thought, ""The old woman is snoring so loudly. You had better see if something is wrong with her."""		
A1606	"""The old woman is snoring so loudly. You had better see if something is wrong with her."""		
A1607	"He stepped into the parlor, and when he approached the bed, he saw the wolf lying there. ""So here I find you, you old sinner,"" he said. ""I have been hunting for you a long time."""		
A1608	He was about to aim his rifle when it occurred to him that the wolf might have eaten the grandmother, and that she still might be rescued. So instead of shooting, he took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the wolf's belly.		
A1609	Then Little Red Cap fetched some large stones. She filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he immediately fell down dead.		
A1610	The huntsman skinned the wolf and went home with the pelt.		
A1612	They also tell how Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time,		
A1613	Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time,		
A1614	was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time		
A1616	"""Let's lock the door, so he can't get in."""		
A1617	"""Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap,"" she said to the child. ""Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough."""		
A1618	ittle Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned		
A1620	Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.		
A1622	The huntsman obeyed		
A1623	The huntsman obeyed and took Snow-White into the woods		
A1626	"Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her, and he said, ""Run away, you poor child."""		
A1627	but still it was as if a stone had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her.		
A1634	and wild animals jumped at her, but they did her no harm		
A1635	They were so happy, that they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed.		
A1636	but let her continue to sleep there in the bed.		
A1637	let her continue to sleep there in the bed		
A1638	"But they were friendly and asked, ""What is your name?"""		
A1642	had spared her life		
A1643	"""Yes,"" said Snow-White, ""with all my heart."""		
A1644	"""Yes,"" said Snow-White,"		
A1647	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.		
A1648	This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie,		
A1653	"""Good day, dear woman, what do you have for sale?"""		
A1654	"""I can let that honest woman in,"" thought Snow-White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty bodice lace."		
A1655	The unsuspecting Snow-White		
A1658	"Take care and let no one in when we are not with you."""		
A1659	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A1661	"Snow-White looked out and said, ""Go on your way. I am not allowed to let anyone in."""		
A1662	"""You surely may take a look,"" said the old woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it up. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door."		
A1663	. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door.		
A1668	"""I am not allowed to let anyone in. The dwarfs have forbidden me to do so."""		
A1669	Snow-White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the peasant woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half.		
A1670	You, my queen, are fairest of all.		
A1671	They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days.		
A1673	"Then he said to the dwarfs, ""Let me have the coffin. I will give you anything you want for it."" But the dwarfs answered, ""We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."""		
A1675	As he thus spoke, the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him the coffin		
A1677	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But the young queen is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A1678	Then they put a pair of iron shoes into burning coals. They were brought forth with tongs and placed before her. She was forced to step into the red-hot shoes and dance until she fell down dead.		
A1682	"One day it happened that the father was going to the fair, and he asked his two stepdaughters what he should bring back for them. ""Beautiful dresses,"" said the one. ""Pearls and jewels,"" said the other. ""And you, Cinderella,"" he said, ""what do you want?"" ""Father, break off for me the first twig that brushes against your hat on your way home."""		
A1689	Two white pigeons came in through the kitchen window, and then the turtledoves, and finally all the birds beneath the sky came whirring and swarming in, and lit around the ashes. The pigeons nodded their heads and began to pick, pick, pick, pick. And the others also began to pick, pick, pick, pick. They gathered all the good grains into the bowls. Before a half hour had passed they were finished, and they all flew out again		
A1690	Two white pigeons came in through the kitchen window, and then the turtledoves, and finally all the birds beneath the sky came whirring and swarming in, and lit around the ashes. The pigeons nodded their heads and began to pick, pick, pick, pick. And the others also began to pick, pick, pick, pick. They gathered all the good grains into the bowl. Hardly one hour had passed before they were finished, and they all flew out again		
A1701	on the hazel tree, sat the two pigeons, crying out: Rook di goo, rook di goo! There's blood in the shoe. The shoe is too tight, This bride is not right!		
A1707	Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was running from it		
A1708	He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking all red		
A1710	"When she stood up the prince looked into her face, and he recognized the beautiful girl who had danced with him. He cried out, ""She is my true bride."""		
A1711	the two white pigeons cried out: Rook di goo, rook di goo! No blood's in the shoe. The shoe's not too tight, This bride is right!		
A1712	After they had cried this out, they both flew down and lit on Cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there		
A1714	"""No, Cinderella, you have no clothes, and you don't know how to dance"		
A1715	When she arrived at the festival in this dress, everyone was so astonished that they did not know what to say		
A1716	"""The unknown girl has eluded me"		
A1717	the prince did not know where she had gone		
A1718	then he told him that the unknown girl had jumped into the pigeon coop		
A1719	And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness as long as they lived		
A1720	The girl went out to her mother's grave every day and wept, and she remained pious and good		
A1721	"""Dear child, remain pious and good, and then our dear God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you."""		
A1726	So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls, and jewels for his two stepdaughters. On his way home, as he was riding through a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. Then he broke off the twig and took it with him. Arriving home, he gave his stepdaughters the things that they had asked for, and he gave Cinderella the twig from the hazel bush		
A1727	Cinderella thanked him, went to her mother's grave, and planted the branch on it		
A1728	Cinderella went to this tree three times every day, and beneath it she wept and prayed		
A1732	He had them bring him an ax and a pick so that he could break the pigeon coop apart, but no one was inside		
A1734	"The prince had waited until she came, then immediately took her by the hand, and danced only with her. When others came and asked her to dance with them, he said, ""She is my dance partner."""		
A1735	"I believe she has climbed up the pear tree. The father thought, ""Could it be Cinderella?"" He had an ax brought to him and cut down the tree, but no one was in it"		
A1738	"The prince danced only with her, and whenever anyone else asked her to dance, he would say, ""She is my dance partner."""		
A1739	The prince, however, had set a trap. He had had the entire stairway smeared with pitch. When she ran down the stairs, her left slipper stuck in the pitch		
A1740	"""No one shall be my wife except for the one whose foot fits this golden shoe."""		
A1744	She sat down on a stool, pulled her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, and it fitted her perfectly		
A1746	No one knew where he took them, for none of them ever returned		
A1757	She took the keys and the egg, and promised to take good care of everything		
A1761	The second sister brought him a piece of bread		
A1762	the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread		
A1763	He appeared to be a poor, weak beggar, and he carried a pack basket on his back, as though he wanted to collect some benevolent offerings in it. He asked for a bit to eat, and when the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread		
A1764	he saw from the red stain that she had been in the blood chamber		
A1771	In spite of this she proceeded to gather their parts together, placing them back in order: head, body, arms, and legs. Then, when nothing else was missing, the parts began to move		
A1772	"When the man returned home he immediately demanded the keys and the egg, and when he was unable to detect any trace of blood on them, he said, ""You have passed the test. You shall be my bride."""		
A1777	"""The moment is here when I can rescue you. The evildoer himself shall carry you home. As soon as you have arrived at home send help to me."""		
A1783	When everything was ready she dipped herself into a barrel of honey, then cut open the bed and rolled around in it until she looked like a strange bird, and no one would have been able to recognize her		
A1786	the bride's brothers and relatives arrived. They had been sent to rescue her		
A1787	After he and all his guests had gone into the house, the bride's brothers and relatives arrived. They had been sent to rescue her. After closing up all the doors of the house so that no one could escape, they set it afire, and the sorcerer, together with his gang, all burned to death		
A1789	As soon as he had gone she walked about in the house from top to bottom examining everything		
A1790	She examined the key. It looked like any other one. She put it into the lock and twisted it a little, and then the door sprang open		
A1792	Every time that he stopped walking, someone called out, and he had to walk on until, groaning and out of breath, he brought the basket with the gold and the two girls to their parents' house		
A1794	"Underway some of the wedding guests met her, and they asked, ""You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from?"" ""I am coming from Fitcher's house."""		
A1795	"""You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from?"" ""I am coming from Fitcher's house."		
A1796	"""Why do you torment yourself with chopping wood? I will make you rich if you will promise me that which is standing behind your mill."""		
A1798	"All at once all the chests and boxes are full, and no one brought it here, and I don't know where it came from."""		
A1800	The miller's daughter was a beautiful and pious girl, and she lived the three years worshipping God and without sin		
A1801	When the time was up and the day came when the evil one was to get her, she washed herself clean and drew a circle around herself with chalk		
A1807	"She answered, ""Dear father, do with me what you will. I am your child,"" and with that she stretched forth both hands and let her father chop them off"		
A1808	Compassionate people will give me as much as I need		
A1810	"The miller spoke to her, ""I have gained great wealth through you. I shall take care of you in splendor as long as you live."""		
A1812	He closed a head gate, so that the moat dried up, and she could walk through		
A1813	Then she kneeled down and, crying out to God the Lord, she prayed. Suddenly an angel appeared		
A1814	She entered the garden, and the angel went with her		
A1818	"The king said, ""How did the spirit get across the water? And where did it go after it had eaten the pear?"""		
A1819	"The king said, ""If what you said is true, I will keep watch with you tonight."""		
A1820	After it was dark the king entered the garden, bringing a priest with him who was to talk to the spirit		
A1821	After it was dark the king entered the garden, bringing a priest with him who was to talk to the spirit. All three sat down under the tree and kept watch		
A1823	"She answered, ""I am not a spirit, but a poor human who has been abandoned by everyone except God."""		
A1825	She gave birth to a beautiful son. The old mother quickly wrote this in a letter, giving the joyful news to the king		
A1831	"Then she said to the queen, ""I cannot have you killed as the king has ordered, but you can no longer stay here. Go out into the wide world with your child, and never come back."""		
A1832	She came to a great, wild forest where she got onto her knees and prayed to God. Then the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a small house		
A1834	"On it was a small sign with the words, ""Here anyone can live free."""		
A1835	"Then the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a small house. On it was a small sign with the words, ""Here anyone can live free."""		
A1838	And through the grace of God and her own piety her chopped-off hands grew back		
A1840	"Then she continued to speak, ""I did what you ordered,"" and showed him as proof the eyes and the tongue"		
A1841	"Then the king began to weep even more bitterly for his poor wife and his little son, until the old woman had mercy and said to him, ""Be satisfied that she is still alive. I secretly had a doe killed and took the proofs from it. I tied your wife's child onto her back and told her to go out into the wide world, and she had to promise never to come back here, because you were so angry with her."""		
A1842	He neither ate nor drank during the entire time, but God kept him alive		
A1843	"Finally he came to a great forest, where he found a little house with a sign containing the words, "" Here anyone can live free."""		
A1844	"He answered, ""I have been traveling about for nearly seven years looking for my wife and her child, but I cannot find them."""		
A1845	The angel offered him something to eat and drink, but he did not take it, wanting only to rest a little		
A1847	"""Mother, dear, how can I cover my father's face? I have no father in this world. I have learned to pray, 'Our father which art in heaven,' and you have said that my father is in heaven, and that he is our dear God. How can I know such a wild man? He is not my father."""		
A1850	"The angel went into the other room, brought back the silver hands, and showed them to him. Now he saw for sure that it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed them, and rejoiced, and said, ""A heavy stone has fallen from my heart."""		
A1852	they went back home to his old mother. There was great joy everywhere, and the king and the queen conducted their wedding ceremony once again, and they lived happily until their blessed end		
A1853	He took her home with him to his royal castle, and because she was so beautiful and pure he loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her, and took her as his wife		
A1855	The king finally came back home from the battlefield, and the first thing he wanted to do was to see his wife and their child		
A1856	"Then the king said, ""I will go as far as the sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have found my dear wife and my child again, provided that in the meantime they have not died or perished from hunger."""		
A1858	All at once all the chests and boxes are full, and no one brought it here, and I don't know where it came from.		
A1859	"""How did you know that I am a queen?"""		
A1860	"She said, ""I am your wife, and this is your son Filled-with-Grief."""		
A1862	This frightened the father, and he promised to obey him		
A1863	"""My child, if I do not chop off both of your hands, then the devil will take me away, and in my fear I have promised him to do this"		
A1867	by the light of the moon she saw that inside there were trees full of beautiful fruit		
A1869	She saw a fruit tree with beautiful pears, but they had all been counted		
A1870	She stepped up to the tree and ate from it with her mouth, enough to satisfy her hunger, but no more		
A1880	"The angel said to her, ""Go into the next room with your child. Your husband has come."""		
A1881	"The angel said to her, ""Go into the next room with your child. Your husband has come."" She went to where he was lying"		
A1890	He who says A must also say B, and because he had given in the first time, he had to do so the second time as well		
A1891	"But he comforted his little sister and said, ""Don't cry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will help us."""		
A1893	When it was midday Gretel shared her bread with Hansel		
A1897	In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones		
A1898	"The duckling came up to them, and Hansel climbed onto it, then asked his little sister to sit down next to him.  ""No,"" answered Gretel. ""That would be too heavy for the duckling. It should take us across one at a time."""		
A1899	Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets		
A1901	"""Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way."""		
A1904	"""But now we must leave,"" said Hansel, ""and get out of these witch-woods."""		
A1907	I know what to do		
A1908	they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching		
A1910	"""We cannot get across,"" said Hansel. ""I cannot see a walkway or a bridge."" ""There are no boats here,"" answered Gretel, ""but there is a white duck swimming. If I ask it, it will help us across."""		
A1912	Gretel put the bread under her apron, because Hansel's pockets were full of stones		
A1913	as soon as the adults had fallen asleep, he got up, pulled on his jacket, opened the lower door, and crept outside. The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house were glistening like silver coins. Hansel bent over and filled his jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit		
A1914	"""Don't worry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will not forsake us."" Then he went back to bed"		
A1916	Then all together they set forth into the woods		
A1922	"Hansel comforted her, ""Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way."""		
A1923	After the full moon had come up, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles that glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked throughout the entire night, and as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father's house		
A1925	On the way to the woods, Hansel crumbled his piece in his pocket, then often stood still, and threw crumbs onto the ground		
A1928	"""Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home."""		
A1932	Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far		
A1933	Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching		
A1934	Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch's house		
A1940	"The good servant, who understood little about money, put his wealth into his pocket, and thought, ""Ah, now that I have a full purse, why should I worry and continue to plague myself with hard work?"" So he set forth, uphill and down, singing and jumping for joy"		
A1942	"""Listen,"" said the dwarf, ""I am a poor and needy man. Give me your three hellers. I can no longer work, but you are young and can easily earn your bread."""		
A1943	"""Listen,"" said the dwarf, ""I am a poor and needy man. Give me your three hellers. I can no longer work, but you are young and can easily earn your bread."" Now because the servant had a good heart and felt pity for the dwarf, he gave him his three hellers, saying, ""In God's name, I won't miss them."" Then the dwarf said, ""Because I see that you have a good heart I will grant you three wishes, one for each heller. They shall all be fulfilled."""		
A1946	"""Judge, sir,"" he said"		
A1947	The judge asked		
A1948	"""God forbid,"" said the Jew. ""He didn't have a naked dagger, but rather a blowpipe hanging from his back, and a fiddle from his neck. The scoundrel can easily be recognized."""		
A1949	The judge sent his people out after him. They found the good servant, who had been walking along quite slowly. And they found the purse with the money on him as well		
A1950	"When he was brought before the judge he said, ""I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money"		
A1951	He offered it to me freely		
A1952	"""God forbid!"" cried the Jew. ""He is reaching for lies like flies on the wall."""		
A1953	"The judge did not believe his story, and said, ""That is a poor excuse. No Jew would do that."""		
A1957	he ran into the town to the judge		
A1958	"""Yes,"" said the judge, ""if you do not ask for your life."""		
A1959	"The servant walked quietly up the ladder with the hangman, but on the last rung he turned around and said to the judge, ""Grant me just one request before I die."" ""Yes,"" said the judge, ""if you do not ask for your life."""		
A1960	"But the judge said, ""Why should I not grant him this short pleasure? It has been promised to him, and he shall have it."""		
A1962	the judge, the clerks, and the court officials		
A1963	The hangman released the good servant and made ready to dance		
A1964	The judge and the Jew were out in front and were the best at jumping		
A1965	Soon everyone who had gathered in the marketplace out of curiosity was dancing with them, old and young, fat and thin, all together with each other. Even the dogs that had run along with the crowd stood up on their hind legs and hopped along as well		
A1966	the judge, quite out of breath, shouted		
A1969	"He went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground gasping for air, and said, ""You rogue, now confess where you got the money, or I will take my fiddle off my neck and begin to play again."""		
A1970	With that the judge had the Jew led to the gallows and hanged as a thief		
A1972	At the second stroke they all lifted their legs		
A1973	At the third stroke everyone jumped up and began to dance		
A1974	The longer he played, the higher the dancers jumped		
A1982	"""Grant me just one request before I die."" ""Yes,"" said the judge, ""if you do not ask for your life."""		
A1985	As he played the first stroke, they all began to quiver and shake		
A1995	And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace		
A1997	"This made the woman angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school."""		
A1998	"""Mother,"" said the little daughter, ""is brother not to have one too?"" This made the woman angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school."""		
A1999	"Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, ""My son, do you want an apple?"""		
A2005	"""Marlene,"" said the mother, ""what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it. It cannot be helped now. We will cook him into stew."""		
A2011	My mother, she killed me, My father, he ate me, My sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I		
A2014	and they all came out into the street and looked at the bird and saw how beautiful he was, and what fine red and green feathers he had, and how his neck was like pure gold, and how his eyes shone like stars in his head		
A2018	In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack		
A2021	My father, he ate me		
A2022	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf		
A2025	"""Yes,"" he said, ""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" ""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."""		
A2031	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I		
A2034	My father, he ate me, Then the woman fell down as if she were dead		
A2037	And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death		
A2038	when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate		
A2042	Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it		
A2045	He invited not only his relatives, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women so that they would be kindly disposed toward the child		
A2048	the wise women presented the child with their magic gifts. The one gave her virtue, the second one beauty, the third one wealth, and so on with everything that one could wish for on earth		
A2055	When he touched her with the kiss Little Brier-Rose opened her eyes, awoke, and looked at him kindly		
A2056	They went downstairs together		
A2061	Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap		
A2062	"One day her mother said to her, ""Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your grandmother. And when you enter her parlor, don't forget to say 'Good morning,' and don't peer into all the corners first."" ""I'll do everything just right,"" said Little Red Cap, shaking her mother's hand"		
A2063	She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him		
A2064	"""Her house is good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place,"" said Little Red Cap"		
A2066	But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door		
A2071	"""Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!"" ""All the better to hear you with."" ""Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!"" ""All the better to see you with."" ""Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!"" ""All the better to grab you with!"" ""Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have!"" ""All the better to eat you with!"""		
A2072	He was about to aim his rifle when it occurred to him that the wolf might have eaten the grandmother, and that she still might be rescued. So instead of shooting, he took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the wolf's belly		
A2074	Then Little Red Cap fetched some large stones. She filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he immediately fell down dead. The three of them were happy		
A2075	He stepped into the parlor, and when he approached the bed, he saw the wolf lying there		
A2076	They also tell how Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time, when another wolf spoke to her and wanted her to leave the path. But Little Red Cap took care and went straight to grandmother's		
A2078	"""Come,"" said the grandmother. ""Let's lock the door, so he can't get in."""		
A2080	"But the grandmother saw what he was up to. There was a large stone trough in front of the house. ""Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap,"" she said to the child. ""Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough."" Little Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned"		
A2082	"""Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap,"" she said to the child. ""Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough.""

He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned"		
A2083	They remained silent, and did not open the door		
A2084	Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next		
A2085	she came to be known as Little Red Cap		
A2089	Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth		
A2090	she knew that the mirror spoke the truth		
A2091	it is true		
A2092	she had no peace day and night		
A2093	Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her		
A2096	Then she began to run. She ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and wild animals jumped at her, but they did her no harm. She ran as far as her feet could carry her, and just as evening was about to fall she saw a little house and went inside in order to rest		
A2101	The seventh dwarf had to sleep with his companions, one hour with each one		
A2102	they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed		
A2104	there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with snow-white sheets		
A2105	Snow-White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate, and from each mug she drank a drop of wine		
A2106	"""If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want."""		
A2109	she knew that the mirror did not lie		
A2112	"Knocking on the door she called out, ""Beautiful wares for sale, for sale!"" Snow-White peered out the window and said, ""Good day, dear woman, what do you have for sale?"""		
A2113	"""I can let that honest woman in,"" thought Snow-White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty bodice lace"		
A2116	all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow-White had come back to life		
A2120	"After they had agreed on the purchase, the old woman said, ""Now let me comb your hair properly."""		
A2127	Now the apple had been so artfully made that only the red half was poisoned		
A2130	"""If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want."" ""Yes,"" said Snow-White, ""with all my heart."""		
A2135	They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days		
A2136	They lifted her up and looked for something poisonous. They undid her laces. They combed her hair. They washed her with water and wine. But nothing helped. The dear child was dead, and she remained dead. They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days. They were going to bury her, but she still looked as fresh as a living person, and still had her beautiful red cheeks		
A2137	"They said, ""We cannot bury her in the black earth,"""		
A2138	"They said, ""We cannot bury her in the black earth,"		
A2140	Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain, and one of them always stayed with it and watched over her		
A2141	The animals too came and mourned for Snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and finally a dove		
A2142	Then they put a pair of iron shoes into burning coals. They were brought forth with tongs and placed before her. She was forced to step into the red-hot shoes and dance until she fell down dead		
A2143	I Do here most humbly lay this small Present at Your Majesties Royal feet		
A2145	the greatness of your Mercy and your Knowledge		
A2147	you will not esteem the least work of Nature, or Art, unworthy your Observation		
A2153	I could not but think my self oblig’d, in consideration of those many Ingagements you have laid upon me, to offer these my poor Labours to this MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ASSEMBLY.		
A2156	grounded and confirm’d by Experiments		
A2162	able to behold the works of Nature		
A2165	By the addition of such artificial Instruments and methods, there may be, in some manner, a reparation made for the mischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self		
A2166	a reparation made for the mischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self		
A2169	upon the evidence, the strength, the integrity, and the right correspondence of all these, all the light, by which our actions are to be guided is to be renewed, and all our command over things is to be establisht.		
A2170	It is therefore most worthy of our consideration, to recollect their several defects, that so we may the better understand how to supply them, and by what assistances we may inlarge their power, and secure them in performing their particular duties.		
A2176	rrors of the understanding are answerable to the two other, being defective both in the quantity and goodness of its knowledge		
A2177	not having a full sensation of the Object, we must be very lame and imperfect in our conceptions about it		
A2179	some they incline to gross ignorance and stupidity		
A2185	These being the dangers in the process of humane Reason		
A2186	he remedies of them all can only proceed from the real, the mechanical, the experimental Philosophy		
A2188	this intends the right ordering of them all, and the making them serviceable to each other.		
A2189	The first thing to be undertaken in this weighty work, is a watchfulness over the failings and an inlargement of the dominion, of the Senses.		
A2191	there should be a scrupulous choice, and a strict examination, of the reality, constancy, and certainty of the Particulars that we admit		
A2192	This is the first rise whereon truth is to begin		
A2193	The next care to be taken, in respect of the Senses, is a supplying of their infirmities with Instruments,		
A2194	as it were, the adding of artificial Organs to the natural; this in one of them has been of late years accomplisht with prodigious benefit to all sorts of useful knowledge,		
A2195	By this means the Heavens are open’d, and a vast number of new Stars, and new Motions, and new Productions appear in them, to which all the antient Astronomers were utterly Strangers.		
A2196	by these helps the subtilty of the composition of Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various texture of their matter, the instruments and manner of their inward motions, and all the other possible appearances of things, may come to be more fully discovered

A2211	only with resolution, and integrity,		
A2212	plain intentions of imploying his Senses aright		
A2213	may venture to compare the reality and the usefulness of his services, towards the true Philosophy		
A2216	It is now high time that it should return to the plainness and soundness of Observations on material and obvious things		
A2219	returning into the same sensible paths, in which it did at first proceed		
A2222	I am so far from that, that I desire him, not absolutely to rely upon these Observations of my eyes, if he finds them contradicted by the future Ocular Experiments of sober and impartial Discoverers		
A2223	if he finds them contradicted by the future Ocular Experiments of sober and impartial Discoverers		
A2224	I have obtained my end, if these my small Labours shall be thought fit to take up some place in the large stock of natural Observations, which so many hands are busie in providing		
A2225	If I have contributed the meanest foundations whereon others may raise nobler Superstructures, I am abundantly satisfied; and all my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me; that I may prepare and furnish them with some Materials, which they may afterwards order and manage with better skill, and to far greater advantage		
A2226	As for my part, I have obtained my end, if these my small Labours shall be thought fit to take up some place in the large stock of natural Observations, which so many hands are busie in providing. If I have contributed the meanest foundations whereon others may raise nobler Superstructures, I am abundantly satisfied; and all my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me; that I may prepare and furnish them with some Materials, which they may afterwards order and manage with better skill, and to far greater advantage

A2230	The Imperfections, which I have already mention’d, to which it is lyable, do either belong to the extent, or the goodness of its knowledge		
A2233	No Intelligence from Men of all Professions, and quarters of the World, to be slighted, and yet all to be so severely examin’d, that there remain no room for doubt or instability		
A2234	much rigour in admitting, much strictness in comparing, and above all, much slowness in debating, and shyness in determining, is to be practised

A2247	by a continual passage round from one Faculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength, as much as the body of man is by the circulation of the blood through the several parts of the body, the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head		
A2248	the links, upon which the true Philosophy depends, of which, if any one be loose, or weak, the whole chain is in danger of being dissolv’d; it is to begin with the Hands and Eyes, and to proceed on through the Memory, to be continued by the Reason; nor is it to stop there, but to come about to the Hands and Eyes again, and so, by a continual passage round from one Faculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength, as much as the body of man is by the circulation of the blood through the several parts of the body, the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head		
A2249	If once this method were followed with diligence and attention, there is nothing that lyes within the power of human Wit (or which is far more effectual) of human Industry, which we might not compass		
A2251	Inventions to equalize those of Copernicus, Galileo, Gilbert, Harvy, and of others, whose Names are almost lost, that were the Inventors of Gun-powder, the Seamans Compass, Printing, Etching, Graving, Microscopes

A2257	The Indeavours of Skilful men have been most conversant about the assistance of the Eye		
A2258	that there is a way open’d for advancing the operations, not only of all the other Senses, but even of the Eye it self		
A2259	that which has been already done ought not to content us, but rather to incourage us to proceed further, and to attempt greater things in the same and different wayes		
A2260	Tis not unlikely, but that there may be yet invented several other helps for the eye, at much exceeding those already found, as those do the bare eye, such as by which we may perhaps be able to discover living Creatures in the Moon, or other Planets, the figures of the compounding Particles of matter, and the particular Schematisms and Textures of Bodies		
A2261	tis not improbable, but that there may be found many Mechanical Inventions to improve our other Senses, of hearing, smelling, tasting, touching		
A2262	there may be found many Mechanical Inventions		
A2264	I can assure the Reader, that I have, by the help of a distended wire, propagated the sound to a very considerable distance in an instant		
A2266	diligence, attention,		
A2267	many mechanical contrivances,		
A2268	something of this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the Air		
A2269	who knows, but that the Industry of man, following this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet higher.		
A2270	There may be also some other mechanical wayes found out, of sensibly perceiving the effluvia of Bodies; several Instances of which, were it here proper, I could give of Mineral steams and exhalations; and it seems not impossible, but that by some such wayes improved, may be discovered, what Minerals lye buried under the Earth, without the trouble to dig for them; some things to confirm this Conjecture may be found in Agricola, and other Writers of Minerals, speaking of the Vegetables that are apt to thrive, or pine, in those steams.  Whether also those steams, which seem to issue out of the Earth, and mix with the Air (and so to precipitate some aqueous Exhalations, wherewith ’tis impregnated) may not be by some way detected before they produce the effect, seems hard to determine; yet something of this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the Air; by which I constantly find, that before, and during the time of rainy weather, the pressure of the Air is less, and in dry weather, but especially when an Eastern Wind (which having past over vast tracts of Land is heavy with Earthy Particles) blows, it is much more, though these changes are varied according to very odd Laws.  The Instrument is this. I prepare a pretty capacious Bolt-head AB, with a small stem about two foot and a half long DC; upon the end of this D I put on a small bended Glass, or brazen syphon DEF (open at D, E and F, but to be closed with cement at F and E, as occasion serves) whose stem F should be about six or eight inches long, but the bore of it not above half an inch diameter, and very even; these I fix very strongly together by the help of very hard Cement, and then fit the whole Glass ABCDEF into a long Board, or Frame, in such manner, that almost half the head AB may lye buried in a concave Hemisphere cut into the Board RS; Schem. 1. Fig. 1. then I place it so on the Board RS, as is exprest in the first figure of the first Scheme; and fix it very firm and steady in that posture, so as that the weight of the Mercury that is afterwards to be put into it, may not in the least shake or stir it; then drawing a line XY on the Frame RT, so that it may divide the ball into two equal parts, or that it may pass, as ’twere, through the center of the ball. I begin from that, and divide all the rest of the Board towards UT into inches, and the inches between the 25 and the end E (which need not be above two or three and thirty inches distant from the line XY) I subdivide into Decimals; then stopping the end F with soft Cement, or soft Wax, I invert the Frame, placing the head downwards, and the Orifice E upwards; and by it, with a small Funnel, I fill the whole Glass with Quicksilver; then by stopping the small Orifice E with my finger, I oftentimes erect and invert the whole Glass and Frame, and thereby free the Quicksilver and Glass from all the bubbles or parcels of lurking Air; then inverting it as before, I fill it top full with clear and well strain’d Quicksilver, and having made ready a small ball of pretty hard Cement, by heat made very soft, I press it into the hole E, and thereby stop it very fast; and to secure this Cement from flying out afterward, I bind over it a piece of Leather, that is spread over in the inside with Cement, and wound about it while the Cement is hot: Having thus fastned it, I gently erect again the Glass after this manner: I first let the Frame down edge-wayes, till the edge RV touch the Floor, or ly horizontal; and then in that edging posture raise the end RS; this I do, that if there chance to be any Air hidden in the small Pipe E, it may ascend into the Pipe F, and not into the Pipe DC: Having thus erected it, and hung it by the hole Q, or fixt it perpendicularly by any other means, I open the end F, and by a small Syphon I draw out the Mercury so long, till I find the surface of it AB in the head to touch exactly the line XY; at which time I immediately take away the Syphon, and if by chance it be run somewhat below the line XY, by pouring in gently a little Mercury at F, I raise it again to its desired height, by this contrivance I make all the sensible rising and falling of the Mercury to be visible in the surface of the Mercury in the Pipe F, and scarce any in the head AB. But because there really is some small change of the upper surface also, I find by several Observations how much it rises in the Ball, and falls in the Pipe F, to make the distance between the two surfaces an inch greater then it was before; and the measure that it falls in the Pipe is the length of the inch by which I am to mark the parts of the Tube F, or the Board on which it lyes, into inches and Decimals: Having thus justned and divided it, I have a large Wheel MNOP, whose outmost limb is divided into two hundred equal parts; this by certain small Pillars is fixt on the Frame RT, in the manner exprest in the Figure. In the middle of this, on the back side, in a convenient frame, is placed a small Cylinder, whose circumference is equal to twice the length of one of those divisions, which I find answer to an inch of ascent, or descent, of Mercury: This Cylinder I, is movable on a very small Needle, on the end of which is fixt a very light Index KL, all which are so pois’d on the Axis, or Needle, that no part is heavier then another: Then about this Cylinder is wound a small Clew of Silk, with two small steel Bullets at each end of it GH; one of these, which is somewhat the heavier, ought to be so big, as freely to move to and fro in the Pipe F; by means of which contrivance, every the least variation of the height of the Mercury will be made exceeding visible by the motion to and fro of the small Index KL.  But this is but one way of discovering the effluvia of the Earth mixt with the Air; there may be perhaps many others, witness the Hygroscope, an Instrument whereby the watery steams volatile in the Air are discerned, which the Nose it self is not able to find. This I have describ’d in the following Tract in the Description of the Beard of a wild Oat. Others there are, may be discovered both by the Nose, and by other wayes also. Thus the smoak of burning Wood is smelt, seen, and sufficiently felt by the eyes: The fumes of burning Brimstone are smelt and discovered also by the destroying the Colours of Bodies, as by the whitening of a red Rose: And who knows, but that the Industry of man, following this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet higher.  ’Tis not improbable also, but that our taste may be very much improv’d, either by preparing our taste for the Body, as, after eating bitter things, Wine, or other Vinous liquors, are more sensibly tasted; or else by preparing Bodies for our tast; as the dissolving of Metals with acid Liquors, make them tastable, which were before altogether insipid; thus Lead becomes sweeter then Sugar, and Silver more bitter then Gall, Copper and Iron of most loathsome tasts. And indeed the business of this sense being to discover the presence of dissolved Bodies in Liquors put on the Tongue, or in general to discover that a fluid body has some solid body dissolv’d in it, and what they are; whatever contrivance makes this discovery improves this sense. In this kind the mixtures of Chymical Liquors afford many Instances; as the sweet Vinegar that is impregnated with Lead may be discovered to be so by the affusion of a little of an Alcalizate solution: The bitter liquor of Aqua fortis and Silver may be discover’d to be charg’d with that Metal, by laying in it some plates of Copper: ’Tis not improbable also, but there may be multitudes of other wayes of discovering the parts dissolv’d, or dissoluble in liquors; and what is this discovery but a kind of secundary tasting.  ’Tis not improbable also, but that the sense of feeling may be highly improv’d, for that being a sense that judges of the more gross and robust motions of the Particles of Bodies, seems capable of being improv’d and assisted very many wayes. Thus for the distinguishing of Heat and Cold, the Weather-glass and Thermometer, which I have describ’d in this following Treatise, do exceedingly perfect it; by each of which the least variations of heat or cold, which the most Acute sense is not able to distinguish, are manifested. This is oftentimes further promoted also by the help of Burning-glasses, and the like, which collect and unite the radiating heat. Thus the roughness and smoothness of a Body is made much more sensible by the help of a Microscope, then by the most tender and delicate Hand. Perhaps, a Physitian might, by several other tangible proprieties, discover the constitution of a Body as well as by the Pulse. I do but instance in these, to shew what possibility there may be of many others, and what probability and hopes there were of finding them, if this method were followed; for the Offices of the five Senses being to detect either the subtil and curious Motions propagated through all pellucid or perfectly homogeneous Bodies; Or the more gross and vibrative Pulse communicated through the Air and all other convenient mediums, whether fluid or solid: Or the effluvia of Bodies dissolv’d in the Air; Or the particles of bodies dissolv’d or dissoluble in Liquors, or the more quick and violent shaking motion of heat in all or any of these: whatsoever does any wayes promote any of these kinds of criteria, does afford a way of improving some one sense. And what a multitude of these would a diligent Man meet with in his inquiries? And this for the helping and promoting the sensitive faculty only.  Next, as for the Memory, or retentive faculty, we may be sufficiently instructed from the written Histories of civil actions, what great assistance may be afforded the Memory, in the committing to writing things observable in natural operations. If a Physitian be therefore accounted the more able in his Faculty, because he has had long experience and practice, the remembrance of which, though perhaps very imperfect, does regulate all his after actions: What ought to be thought of that man, that has not only a perfect register of his own experience, but is grown old with the experience of many hundreds of years, and many thousands of men.  And though of late, men, beginning to be sensible of this convenience, have here and there registred and printed some few Centuries, yet for the most part they are set down very lamely and imperfectly, and, I fear, many times not so truly, they seeming, several of them, to be design’d more for Ostentation then publique use: For, not to instance, that they do, for the most part, omit those Experiences they have made, wherein their Patients have miscarried, it is very easie to be perceiv’d, that they do all along hyperbolically extol their own Prescriptions, and vilifie those of others. Notwithstanding all which, these kinds of Histories are generally esteem’d useful, even to the ablest Physitian		
A2271	What may not be expected from the rational or deductive Faculty that is furnisht with such Materials		
A2272	How neer the nature of Axioms must all those Propositions be which are examin’d before so many Witnesses?		
A2274	The Invention of a way to find the Longitude of places is easily perform’d, and that to as great perfection as is desir’d, or to at great an accurateness as the Latitude of places can be found at Sea; and perhaps yet also to a greater certainty then that has been hitherto found, as I shall very speedily freely manifest to the world. The way of flying in the Air seems principally unpracticable, by reason of the want of strength in humane muscles; if therefore that could be suppli’d, it were, I think, easie to make twenty contrivances to perform the office of Wings: What Attempts also I have made for the supplying that Defect, and my successes therein, which, I think, are wholly new, and not inconsiderable, I shall in another place relate.  ’Tis not unlikely also, but that Chymists, if they followed this method, might find out their so much sought for Alkahest. What an universal Menstruum, which dissolves all sorts of Sulphureous Bodies, I have discover’d (which has not been before taken notice of as such) I have shewn in the sixteenth Observation.  What a prodigious variety of Inventions in Anatomy has this latter Age afforded, even in our own Bodies in the very Heart, by which we live, and the Brain, which is the seat of our knowledge of other things? witness all the excellent Works of Pecquet, Bartholinus, Billius, and many others; and at home, of Doctor Harvy, Doctor Ent, Doctor Willis, Doctor Glisson. In Celestial Observations we have far exceeded all the Antients, even the Chaldeans and Egyptians themselves, whose vast Plains, high Towers, and clear Air, did not give them so great advantages over us, as have over them by our Glasses. By the help of which, they have been very much outdone by the famous Galileo, Hevelius, Zulichem; and our own Countrymen, Mr. Rook, Doctor Wren, and the great Ornament of our Church and Nation, the Lord Bishop of Exeter. And to say no more in Aerial Discoveries, there has been a wonderful progress made by the Noble Engine of the most Illustrious Mr. Boyle, whom it becomes me to mention with all honour, not only as my particular Patron, but as the Patron of Philosophy it self; which he every day increases by his Labours, and adorns by his Example.		
A2275	And I do not only propose this kind of Experimental Philosophy as a matter of high rapture and delight of the mind, but even as a material and sensible Pleasure		
A2276	Experimental Philosophy		
A2277	the greatness of your Mercy		
A2278	The good success of all these great Men, and many others, and the now seemingly great obviousness of most of their and divers other Inventions,		
A2279	puts me in mind to recommend such Studies		
A2280	the prosecution of them by such methods		
A2281	So vast it the variety of Objects which will come under their Inspections, so many different wayes there are of handling them, so great is the satisfaction of finding out new things, that I dare compare the contentment which they will injoy, not only to that of contemplation, but even to that which most men prefer of the very Senses themselves		
A2282	there has not been any inquiry or Problem in Mechanicks, that I have hitherto propounded to my self, but by a certain method (which I may on some other opportunity explain) I have been able presently to examine the possibility of it; and if so, as easily to excogitate divers wayes of performing it: And indeed it is possible to do as much by this method in Mechanicks, as by Algebra can be perform’d in Geometry. Nor can I at all doubt, but that the same method is as applicable to Physical Enquiries, and as likely to find and reap thence as plentiful a crop of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren, but may with this good husbandry be highly improv’d		
A2283	it is possible to do as much by this method in Mechanicks, as by Algebra can be perform’d in Geometry. Nor can I at all doubt, but that the same method is as applicable to Physical Enquiries, and as likely to find and reap thence as plentiful a crop of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren, but may with this good husbandry be highly improv’d		
A2284	Toward the prosecution of this method in Physical Inquiries, I have here and there gleaned up an handful of Observations, in the collection of most of which I made use of Microscopes, and some other Glasses and Instruments that improve the sense		
A2287	to make us, with the great Conqueror, to be affected that we have not yet overcome one World when there are so many others to be discovered, every considerable improvement of Telescopes or Microscopes producing new Worlds and Terra-Incognita’s to our view		
A2288	The Glasses I used were of our English make, but though very good of the kind, yet far short of what might be expected, could we once find a way of making Glasses Elliptical, or of some more true shape; for though both Microscopes, and Telescopes, as they now are, will magnifie an Object about a thousand thousand times bigger then it appears to the naked eye; yet the Apertures of the Object-glasses are so very small, that very few Rays are admitted, and even of those few there are so many false, that the Object appears dark and indistinct: And indeed these inconveniences are such, as seem inseparable from Spherical Glasses, even when most exactly made; but the way we have hitherto made use of for that purpose is so imperfect, that there may be perhaps ten wrought before one be made tolerably good, and most of those ten perhaps every one differing in goodness one from another, which is an Argument, that the way hitherto used is, at least, very uncertain. So that these Glasses have a double defect; the one, that very few of them are exactly true wrought; the other, that even of those that are best among them, none will admit a sufficient number of Rayes to magnifie the Object beyond a determinate bigness. Against which Inconveniences the only Remedies I have hitherto met with are these		
A2289	for Microscopes (where the Object we view is near and within our power) the best way of making it appear bright in the Glass, is to cast a great quantity of light on it by means of convex glasses, for thereby, though the aperture be very small, yet there will throng in through it such multitudes, that an Object will by this means indure to be magnifi’d as much again as it would be without it		
A2290	As for Telescopes, the only improvement they seem capable of, is the increasing of their length		
A2291	I have experimentally observ’d in one of that length made by Mr. Richard Reives here at London		
A2292	And for performing both these, I cannot imagine any way more easie, and more exact, then by this following Engine, by means of which, any Glasses, of what length soever, may be speedily made. It seems the most easie, because with one and the same Tool may be with care ground an Object Glass, of any length or breadth requisite, and that with very little or no trouble in fitting the Engine, and without much skill in the Grinder. It seems to be the most exact, for to the very last stroke the Glass does regulate and rectifie the Tool to its exact Figure; and the longer or more the Tool and Glass are wrought together, the more exact will both of them be of the desir’d Figure. Further, the motions of the Glass and Tool do so cross each other, that there is not one point of eithers Surface, but has thousands of cross motions thwarting it, so that there can be no kind of Rings or Gutters made either in the Tool or Glass		
A2293	supposing the Mandrils well made, and of a good length, and supposing great care be used in working and polishing them, I see no reason, but that a Glass of a thousand, nay of ten thousand foot long, may be as well made as one of ten		
A2295	we are certain, from the Laws of refraction		
A2296	I have experimentally found to be so, by an Instrument I shall presently describe		
A2297	I have experimentally found to be so		
A2298	if Glasses could be made of those kind of Figures, or some other, such as the most incomparable Des Cartes has invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works, we might hope for a much greater perfection of Opticks then can be rationally expected from spherical ones		
A2299	as the most incomparable Des Cartes has invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works		
A2301	though I know two or three wayes, which, as far as I have yet considered, seem very probable, and may invite me to make a tryal as soon as I have an opportunity, of which I may hereafter perhaps acquaint the world		
A2302	to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals; and to let them see that the laws of Refraction are not only notional		
A2303	to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals		
A2304	By means of this Instrument I can with little trouble, and a very small quantity of any Liquor, examine, most accurately, the refraction of it not only for one inclination, but for all; and thereby am inabled to make very accurate Tables		
A2305	I have also experimentally made, and find, that Oyl of Turpentine has a much greater Refraction then Spirit of Wine, though it be lighter; and that Spirit of Wine has a greater Refraction then Water, though it be lighter also; but that salt Water also has a greater Refraction then fresh, though it be heavier: but Alum water has a less refraction then common Water, though heavier also. So that it seems, as to the refraction made in a Liquor, the specifick gravity is of no efficacy. By this I have also found that look what proportion the Sine of the Angle of one Inclination has to the Sine of the Angle of Refraction, correspondent to it, the same proportion have all the Sines of other Inclinations to the Sines of their appropriate Refractions.		
A2306	Now though this were the Instrument I made most use of, yet I have made several other Tryals with other kinds of Microscopes, which both for matter and form were very different from common spherical Glasses. I have made a Microscope with one piece of Glass, both whose surfaces were plains. I have made another only with a plano concave, without any kind of reflection, divers also by means of reflection. I have made others of Waters, Gums, Resins, Salts, Arsenick, Oyls, and with divers other mixtures of watery and oyly Liquors. And indeed the subject is capable of a great variety; but I find generally none more useful then that which is made with two Glasses, such as I have already describ’d.		
A2308	this was undertaken in prosecution of the Design which the ROYAL SOCIETY has propos’d to it self. For the Members of the Assembly having before their eys so many fatal Instances of the errors and falshoods, in which the greatest part of mankind has so long wandred, because they rely’d upon the strength of humane Reason alone, have begun anew to correct all Hypotheses by sense, as Seamen do their dead Reckonings by Cœlestial Observations; and to this purpose it has been their principal indeavour to enlarge & strengthen the Senses by Medicine, and by such outward Instruments as are proper for their particular works		
A2309	in prosecution of the Design which the ROYAL SOCIETY has propos’d to it self		
A2313	And the ends of all these Inquiries they intend to be the Pleasure of Contemplative minds, but above all, the ease and dispatch of the labours of mens hands. They do indeed neglect no opportunity to bring all the rare things of Remote Countries within the compass of their knowledge and practice		
A2315	And of this kind I ought not to conceal one particular Generosity, which more nearly concerns my self. It is the munificence of Sir John Cutler		
A2316	endowing a Lecture for the promotion of Mechanick Arts, to be governed and directed by This Society.This Bounty I mention for the Honourableness of the thing it self, and for the expectation which I have of the efficacy of the Example		
A2319	If these my first Labours shall be any wayes useful to inquiring men, I must attribute the incouragement and promotion of them to a very Reverend and Learned Person, of whom this ought in justice to be said, That there is scarce any one Invention, which this Nation has produc’d in our Age, but it has some way or other been set forward by his assistance		
A2321	In the sweetness of whose behaviour, in the calmness of his mind, in the unbounded goodness of his heart, we have an evident Instance, what the true and the primitive unpassionate Religion was, before it was sowred by particular Factions		
A2322	I thank God, that Dr. Wilkins was an Englishman, for whereever he had lived, there had been the chief Seat of generous Knowledge and true Philosophy		
A2323	By the Advice of this Excellent man I first set upon this Enterprise, yet still came to it with much Reluctancy, because I was to follow the footsteps of so eminent a Person as Dr. Wren, who was the first that attempted any thing of this nature; whose original draughts do now make one of the Ornaments of that great Collection of Rarities in the Kings Closet. This Honor, which his first beginnings of this kind have receiv’d, to be admitted into the most famous place of the world, did not so much incourage, as the hazard of coming after Dr. Wren did affright me; for of him I must affirm, that, since the time of Archimedes, there scarce ever met in one man, in so great a perfection, such a Mechanical Hand, and so Philosophical a Mind.  But at last, being assured both by Dr. Wilkins, and Dr. Wren himself, that he had given over his intentions of prosecuting it, and not finding that there was any else design’d the pursuing of it, I set upon this undertaking, and was not a little incourag’d to proceed in it, by the Honour the Royal Society was pleas’d to favour me with, in approving of those draughts (which from time to time as I had an opportunity of describing) I presented to them. And particularly by the Incitements of divers of those Noble and excellent Persons of it, which were my more especial Friends, who were not less urgent with me for the publishing, then for the prosecution of them.  After I had almost compleated these Pictures and Observations (having had divers of them engraven, and was ready to send them to the Press) I was inform’d, that the Ingenious Physitian Dr. Henry Power had made several Microscopical Observations, which had I not afterwards, upon our interchangably viewing each others Papers, found that they were for the most part differing from mine, either in the Subject it self, or in the particulars taken notice of; and that his design was only to print Observations without Pictures, I had even then suppressed what I had so far proceeded in. But being further excited by several of my Friends, in compliance with their opinions, that it would not be unacceptable to several inquisitive Men, and hoping also, that I should thereby discover something New to the World, I have at length cast in my Mite, into the vast Treasury of A Philosophical History. And it is my hope, as well as belief, that these my Labours will be no more comparable to the Productions of many other Natural Philosophers, who are now every where busie about greater things; then my little Objects are to be compar’d to the greater and more beautiful Works of Nature, A Flea, a Mite, a Gnat, to an Horse, an Elephant, or a Lyon.		
A2324	you can forgive the most presumptuous Offendors		
A2327	The Rules YOU have prescrib’d YOUR selves in YOUR Philosophical Progress do seem the best that have ever yet been practis’d. And particularly that of avoiding Dogmatizing, and the espousal of any Hypothesis not sufficiently grounded and confirm’d by Experiments. This way seems the most excellent, and may preserve both Philosophy and Natural History from its former Corruptions		
A2329	we cannot but observe them to be in many particulars much outdone by those of other Creatures		
A2330	all the other degrees of Reason, are lyable to the same imperfection

A2348	I have produced nothing here, with intent to bind his understanding to an implicit consent		
A2349	If I have contributed the meanest foundations whereon others may raise nobler Superstructures, I am abundantly satisfied		
A2350	and all my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me;		
A2351	I may prepare and furnish them with some Materials, which they may afterwards order and manage with better skill, and to far greater advantage.

A2360	And as at first, mankind fell by tasting of the forbidden Tree of Knowledge, so we, their Posterity, may be in part restor’d by the same way, not only by beholding and contemplating, but by tasting too those fruits of Natural knowledge, that were never yet forbidden.		
A2362	as Glasses have highly promoted our seeing, so ’tis not improbable, but that there may be found many Mechanical Inventions to improve our other Senses, of hearing, smelling, tasting, touching

A2504	She carefully pulled her two sisters out of hell and hid them

A2518	Maria was clever, and she filled her pockets with bran		
A2519	As she walked along behind her father, from time to time she threw down a little pile of bran onto the pathway		
A2521	"""Father,"" said Maria, ""I will climb down and get it."""		
A2522	Following the bran, she finally arrived home again, late that night.		
A2524	some time later she again told her husband that he should take Maria out into the country and abandon her in the woods. The next morning the man called his daughter once again, and they set forth.		
A2527	The next morning they left, but the youngest brother remained at home in order to cook the food and clean the house		
A2528	After they had left, the youngest brother went out to buy food.		
A2529	Maria came out from behind the dough trough, swept and cleaned the house, and then put the kettle on the fire in order to cook the beans.		
A2533	When the other brothers returned home, they were satisfied with this, so Maria stayed with the seven robbers, did their housekeeping, and was always quiet and diligent.

A2540	When they came to the king's castle they saw that the stall door was wide open. They drove the oxen inside, in order to bring the cart into the stall.		
A2541	Hearing the noise, the king sent someone down to ask the stall-master what had happened		
A2542	He had four large wax candles brought and had them placed at the four corners of the coffin and lit.		
A2548	"The young king said joyfully to his mother, ""This girl shall be my wife!"" The old queen answered, ""Yes, so shall it be!"" and she embraced Maria."

A2553	"The father said, ""Eh! my daughter, if I take another wife, you will have great troubles."""		
A2557	they remained peaceful and contended.		
A2562	But meanwhile the blows redoubled, and curiosity forced her to look out of the window		
A2570	the chief struck her enchanted wand, and commanded a beautiful rich casket all covered with diamonds and other precious stones to appear; then the others made a beautiful garland of flowers and gold, put it on the young girl, and then laid her in the casket, which was so rich and beautiful that it was marvelous to behold		
A2574	the king had been victorious, and should return to his palace in a few days

A2598	the maid who brought food to her every day		
A2600	"""Where is the beautiful girl whom I saw in the hallway?"" he asked the maid who was serving him."		
A2606	"Take me with you, because I'll not be able to return without the girl."""		
A2607	The king promised to do this		
A2609	Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me		
A2610	"""Of course the poor child is sick,"" answered the maid. She is always kept inside never gets any fresh air. Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me. Those few steps will bring her back to health."""		
A2611	"""Just what does the girl have that makes her so ill?"" asked the mother. ""Of course the poor child is sick,"" answered the maid. She is always kept inside never gets any fresh air. Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me. Those few steps will bring her back to health."" The mother agreed to this, and the next morning the maid and the daughter left for the fair."		
A2612	He gave the faithful maid so much money that she was able to move to a different country with her entire family.		
A2615	"""Mother, dear, I must go away. I entrust my dear wife to you."		
A2616	Not long afterward the young queen gave birth to her first son, and the old queen took good care of her. She immediately wrote a letter to the king telling him of the birth of his son.		
A2617	while he was eating, the innkeeper asked him where he was from and where he was going		
A2621	he wrote to the old queen that she should take good care of his wife and do nothing until he had returned.		
A2622	The innkeeper asked if the king had sent a response with him.		
A2624	"However, the young queen meekly said, ""I shall do whatever my lord and husband commands!"""		
A2626	She then embraced the old queen and wandered away		
A2629	because she was so good, Saint Joseph caused her hands to grow back		
A2632	His attendants did not dare to say anything to him		
A2633	Saint Joseph invited them in, fed them, and offered them good beds.

A2639	Free in mind must be he who desires to have understanding		
A2640	you read me Galileo's request in his communication to you, and you added your own exhortation.		
A2641	From this dedication learn my love for proclaiming the truth		
A2642	"WHEN MANY PEOPLE asked my opinion about Galileo's ""Sidereal Messenger,"" I decided to satisfy them all by adopting the short cut of circulating in printed form the letter which I sent to Galileo"		
A2643	Whereas most debaters get all heated up, I regard humor as a more pleasant tone in discussions. Other authors strive for impressiveness in the exposition of philosophy by the weightiness of their assertions; yet they often prove amusing, unintentionally. I seem by nature cut out to lighten the hard work and difficulty of a subject by mental relaxation, conveyed by the style.		
A2644	people in the academic world need not be reminded (let others at least imagine) what it means to defend one's position. When a debater does so, he adopts as his own not only true and traditional views but also absurdities and falsities (in the schools frequently, godless, baneful, and blasphemous beliefs as well). He professes, according to the exigencies of his speech, either that he favors these ideas, or accepts them, upholds them, proves them, or will prove them. Yet at heart he believes nothing less, his motive being merely to give his opponent practice in defending the truth. Hence a disputation becomes more entertaining if an unsophisticated speaker is debarred from the truth as his position by being unexpectedly assigned a contrary thesis, and by being ordered to defend what he never thought would have to be defended.		
A2646	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said. I have never belittled or laid false claim to the ideas of others, when I had none of my own. I have never fawned on others, nor have I been self-effacing if I made some better or prior discovery by my own exertions.		
A2647	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said.		
A2648	Yet let no one assume that by my readiness to agree with Galileo I propose to deprive others of their right to disagree with him.		
A2650	I supposed that among others Galileo too, the most highly qualified of all, would discuss with me by mail the new kind of astronomy or celestial physics which I had published, and that he would resume our interrupted correspondence, which had begun twelve years before		
A2651	I swear to reject them without reservation, as soon as any better informed person points out an error to me by a sound method.		
A2653	men of the highest reputation, raised by their erudition, seriousness, and steadfastness far above the unreliability of ordinary people, were transmitting these messages about Galileo		
A2654	I was influenced most by Galileo's prestige, achieved by the soundness of his judgment and the subtlety of his mind.		
A2655	"I behold ""great and most marvelous sights proposed to philosophers and astronomers,"" including myself, if I am not mistaken; I behold ""all lovers of true philosophy summoned to the commencement of great observation."""		
A2656	I craved to plunge into the subject, inasmuch as I was invited; and since I had written on the same topic six years before, I yearned to discuss with you, most accomplished Galileo, in a highly agreeable kind of discourse, the many undisclosed treasures of Jehovah the creator, which He reveals to us one after another. For who is permitted to remain silent at the news of such momentous developments? Who is not filled with a surging love of God, pouring itself copiously forth through tongue and pen?

A2661	My eagerness was stimulated by the orders of the Most August Emperor Rudolph, who requested my opinion about this subject.		
A2663	You did me the honor of thinking that so great a man in particular should encourage me to write; and you sent along a copy of the book and added your own admonition.		
A2664	against the obstinate critics of innovation, for whom anything unfamiliar is unbelievable, for whom anything outside the traditional boundaries of Aristotelian narrowmindedness is wicked and abominable, you may advance reinforced by one partisan.		
A2667	I may perhaps seem rash in accepting your claims so readily with no support from my own experience		
A2668	why should I not believe a most learned mathematician, whose very style attests the soundness of his judgment? He has no intention of practicing deception in a bid for vulgar publicity, nor does he pretend to have seen what he has not seen.

A2671	But why should I not believe a most learned mathematician, whose very style attests the soundness of his judgment? He has no intention of practicing deception in a bid for vulgar publicity, nor does he pretend to have seen what he has not seen. Because he loves the truth, he does not hesitate to oppose even the most familiar opinions, and to bear the jeers of the crowd with equanimity. Does he not make his writings public, and could he possibly hide any villainy that might be perpetrated? Shall I disparage him, a gentleman of Florence, for the things he has seen? Shall I with my poor vision disparage him with his keen sight? Shall he with his equipment of optical instruments be disparaged by me, who must use my naked eyes because I lack these aids? Shall I not have confidence in him, when he invites everybody to see the same sights, and what is of supreme importance, even offers his own instrument in order to gain support on the strength of observations?		
A2672	Why is it that I find part of the book verified by my own experience and also by the affirmations of others?		
A2674	Their conclusions agree with the highly illuminating observations which you report on the same subject. Consequently I have no basis for questioning the rest of your book and the four satellites of Jupiter.		
A2675	I shall discuss with you, Galileo, things which are absolutely certain and which may be seen, I confidently hope, with my own eyes.		
A2677	But here I am trying to induce the skeptical to have faith in your instrument.		
A2679	by your discoveries you caused the sun of truth to rise		
A2680	Putting aside all misgivings, you turned directly to visual experimentation.		
A2682	These are the conditions, I say, which I shall observe in setting up the convex lens, for the purpose of magnifying objects in the field of vision. I shall place the eye not far from the spot where the rays from all points of the object under observation converge at a common focus (this is the function of the hyperbolic nipple). The hyperbola will be extended so far that a ray from this point or center will make an angle of 27° with the tangent at the edge of the hyperbola, and will therefore be refracted about 9°. Thus I shall have at either edge a refraction of about 30 1/2°, but proportionally less in between.  Now the rays from a single point of an object shining so far away come down to the nipple practically parallel. Thereafter they converge and enter the crystalline lens of the eye. Being refracted by the crystalline lens, they meet at a point close behind it. Then they diverge again until, spreading out as though from the tip of a pencil, they strike the retina. Thus from every point on the moon light falls on a separate area of the retina, so that the image becomes quite confused. Therefore I shall adapt a concave lens to the individual eye of each observer in accordance with the variations in their vision. In this way the convergence of the rays from any one point will be stopped by a refraction in the opposite direction accomplished by the concave lens. The rays will diverge instead, and will enter the crystalline lens as though they were coming from some nearby point. After being refracted by the crystalline lens, they will find their points of convergence on the retina itself. This is the definition of clear vision.		
A2685	Under your guidance I recognize that the celestial substance is incredibly tenuous.		
A2686	if fate smiles on me so that I can overcome the obstacles and attempt the mechanical construction, I shall exert myself energetically in that endeavor, pursuing alternative courses. On the one hand, I shall increase the number of lenses. They will have on either side perfectly spherical surfaces of very slight curvature. I shall place them at fixed intervals in the tube, the outer lenses being a little wider. Even so, the eye will be located within the limits of the area where parallel rays passing through all the lenses converge; with regard to these limits, see pages 190 and 440 of my “Optics.” On the other hand, to enable me more easily to correct the aberration (should there be any) in a single surface, I shall design a lens shaped like a nipple, to be used by itself. One of its surfaces will be practically plane, because its curvature will amount to only 1/2 or 30’ of a spherically convex shell. The other surface, which is directed toward the eye, will not be spherical. My intention is to avoid what is illustrated by the diagram on page 194, namely, distortion and confusion of the parts of the object under observation, the subject treated in Proposition 18 on page 193. Instead, the second surface will take the shape of a nipple, as shown in the diagram on page 198. Hence it will resemble the crystalline lens of the eye, because it will be bounded by the curvature of a hyperbolic line. This is the figure which I sought in the diagram on page 106 for the sake of optical devices, as indicated on pages 96 and 109. The aim is to achieve undistorted vision, in which the images of the parts of the object under observation are enlarged proportionally, as set forth on page 105.		
A2687	you have certainly discovered an ingenious method of ascertaining to what extent objects are magnified by your instrument, and how individual minutes and fractions of minutes can be discerned in the heavens		
A2688	Johannes Pistorius, asked me more than once, I recall, whether Brahe’s observations were so refined that in my opinion absolutely nothing could be lacking in them. I vigorously maintained that the pinnacle had been reached, and that nothing further was left to human enterprise, because the eyes would not permit greater precision, nor would the effect of refraction, which alters the position of the stars with reference to the horizon. In rebuttal, he steadfastly declared that some day somebody would come along who would devise a more exact procedure with the help of lenses. I objected on the ground that their refractive properties made lenses unsuitable for reliable observations. But now at last I see that Pistorius was in part a true prophet. To be sure, Brahe's observations speak for themselves and need no praise. For what an arc of 60° is in the heavens, or 34’, is known through Brahe instruments by themselves. But whereas Brahe in this way measured celestial degrees in the heavens (or even I determined the diameter of the moon by my optical device), now your telescope, Galileo, surpasses these attainments. Accepting the numerical results recorded by Brahe and me, it subdivides them with the utmost nicety into minutes and fractions of minutes. It couples itself with Brahe's observational method in a most appropriate marriage, so that Brahe has good reason to rejoice at your method of observation, and you must base your method on Brahe’s.		
A2689	Would you like me to express my feelings? I want your instrument for the study of lunar eclipses, in the hope that it may furnish the most extraordinary aid in improving and where necessary in recasting, the whole of my “Hipparchus” or demonstration of the sizes and distances of the three bodies, sun, moon, and earth. For the variations in the solar and lunar diameters, and the portion of the moon that is eclipsed, will be measured with precision only by the man who is equipped with your telescope and acquires skill in observing.		
A2691	Therefore let Galileo take his stand by Kepler's side. Let the former observe the moon with his face turned skyward, while the latter studies the sun by looking down at a screen (lest the lens injure his eye). Let each employ his own device, and from this partnership may there some day arise an absolutely perfect theory of the distances.		
A2694	If a comet appears, it will be possible to make highly accurate observations of its parallax (like the moon's) by comparison with those quite minute and very numerous stars which are visible only through your instrument. From the parallax measurements we may draw more definite conclusions than we have ever had before about the height of comets.		
A2695	From the parallax measurements we may draw more definite conclusions than we have ever had before about the height of comets.		
A2697	it occurs to me to compete with you in scrutinizing those small spots first noticed by you in the brighter region. Yet, if this is agreed upon, I hope to get results by my own method of observation, with my back to the moon. I shall admit the light of the moon through an aperture to a sheet of paper mounted on a rod. The aperture will be fitted with a crystal lens curving spherically from a circular edge. The paper will be adjusted to the focus of the rays. In this way, with a rod 12 feet long, a perfect image of the body of the moon will be obtained the size of a large silver coin.		
A2698	The paper will be adjusted to the focus of the rays. In this way, with a rod 12 feet long, a perfect image of the body of the moon will be obtained the size of a large silver coin.		
A2699	I explained the device in Proposition 23 on page 196 of my book, and on page 211.		
A2700	you begin your observations by specifying the age of the moon, and for the first time you point out the imperfections of the oval line in the crescent phase. In Number 8 on page 244 of my book I showed that the circle of illumination appears as an oval. What you say, then, is correct and in full accord with mathematics.		
A2705	these suggestions (about cavities that are below the surface and not cut through the mountains) are not so weighty that I would deem them worthy of a stubborn defense, should they be rendered completely untenable by your subsequent reports.		
A2709	"But the flaw in my reasoning is indicated in the margin of the very next page. Obviously the river did not, like the land, shine by light received from the sun, but by light reflected from the illuminated air. Hence my analysis of the causes of the phenomenon was also unfortunate. For, in opposition to the doctrine of Aristotle's book ""On Colors,"" I asserted that water partakes of black less than earth does. Yet how could this be true, since earth turns darker when it is soaked with water? But why go on at length?"		
A2712	"These very acute observations of yours do not lack the support of even my own testimony. For on page 248 of my ""Optics"" you have the half-moon divided by a wavy line. From this fact I deduced peaks and depressions in the body of the moon. On page 250 I describe the moon during an eclipse as looking like torn flesh or broken wood, with bright streaks penetrating into the region in shadow. On the basis of this observation I establish the conclusion, identical with yours, yet reached by a different sort of reasoning, that the parts of the moon are uneven, some being higher and others lower."		
A2714	Pages 252 and 302 of my book could have told you about this air on the moon. These passages in my book are splendidly confirmed by your pertinent observations.		
A2717	This situation would be consistent with my observations.		
A2719	These were performed not only at night, when the explanation might be referred to the conditions of seeing, but also by day, when Venus disappears behind the part of the half-moon that is in shadow.		
A2721	No less ingenious is your arrangement on page 14 inspecting the disk of the moon when its horns first emerge. You explain how to observe from behind a roof so that the horns are covered up and the rest of the disk becomes visible. This is an observational method very familiar to me.		
A2722	There, adopting a procedure identical with yours, I too reject the same suppositions (that this light comes from the sun or from Venus), except that I treat the latter conjecture on its merits somewhat more favorably than you do.		
A2723	"You support my discussion of this redness on page 271 of the “Optics,"" where I derive it from the refraction of the sun's rays in our atmosphere. You also enhance the usefulness of what I said on page 301 by way of explaining why complete darkness does not always occur during a total eclipse of the sun; I repeated these remarks on page 117 in my book on the “New Star.”"		
A2724	"I doubt, Galileo, whether the cause proposed by you can account for this redness. For this dawn-light, as you call it, surrounds the body of the moon much too uniformly to be the source of the redness, which is distributed so unevenly over the moon. This is shown by my observations, as reported on page 276. When you consider this subject in your ""System of the Universe,"" you will, I trust, advance a much more successful explanation of the causes of the phenomena under discussion."		
A2725	I readily grant that, as compared with the celestial bodies in the vicinity of the sun, which I regarded on page 277 as the cause of the pale light, this dawn-light of yours serves as a better explanation.		
A2726	When their small bodies are examined through the telescope, you say that they shrink in comparison with the diameter of the moon. You also mention other things, which truly produce a similar diminution of the stars, as I have known from long experience: twilight, daylight, a cloud, a veil, colored glass.		
A2727	"I should like to ask you, Galileo, whether you are satisfied with the reasons for this effect, as presented by me in my discussion of the process of vision on page 217 and especially on page 221 of my ""Optics."" For if you find nothing amiss, you may hereafter discuss the matter correctly."		
A2728	Point sources of light transmit their cones to the crystalline lens. There refraction takes place, and behind the lens the cones again contract to a point. But this point does not reach as far as the retina. Therefore the light is dispersed once more, and spreads over a small area of the retina, whereas it should impinge on a point. Hence the telescope, by introducing another refraction, makes this point coincide with the retina. It is not true, then, that some rays come down to the eye from the brightness enveloping the stars on the outside. On the contrary, the rays which come down from the shining body itself are scattered, as a result of refraction and the widening of the opening in the uvea at night. They brighten the area on the retina around the point which should represent the star. The telescope on earth does not remove anything from the stars in heaven, but it does take away from the retina whatever light is superfluous.		
A2730	persons with unimpaired vision, using astronomical instruments that are not deceived by these wavy crowns, as is the naked eye, ascertain the dimensions of the stars' diameters in terms of minutes and fractions of minutes		
A2731	You have a large number of eyewitnesses to the innumerability of the stars. The rabbis are said to enumerate more than 12,000. A clergyman of my acquaintance one moonless night counted over 40 in Orion's Shield. The larger stars in the Pleiades are arranged in order by Mästlin to the number of fourteen		
A2732	You have conferred a blessing on astronomers and physicists by revealing the true character of the Milky Way, the nebulae, and the nebulous spirals. You have upheld those writers who long ago reached the same conclusion as you: they are nothing but a mass of stars, whose luminosities blend on account of the dullness of our eyes.  Accordingly, scientists will henceforth cease to create comets and new stars out of the Milky Way, after the manner of Brahe, lest they irrationally assert the passing away of perfect and eternal celestial bodies.		
A2733	Accordingly, scientists will henceforth cease to create comets and new stars out of the Milky Way, after the manner of Brahe, lest they irrationally assert the passing away of perfect and eternal celestial bodies.		
A2739	this will remain an open question until this phenomenon too is detected by someone equipped for marvelously refined observations		
A2740	Therefore, for the sake of those who, as it were, will presently be on hand to attempt this voyage, let us establish the astronomy, Galileo, you of Jupiter, and me of the moon.		
A2741	as soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying, settlers from our species of man will not be lacking. Who would once have thought that the crossing of the wide ocean was calmer and safer than of the narrow Adriatic Sea, Baltic Sea, or English Channel? Given ships or sails adapted to the breezes of heaven, there will be those who will not shrink from even that vast		
A2742	as soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying, settlers from our species of man will not be lacking		
A2744	I have also thought it worth while, in passing, to tweak the ear of the higher philosophy. Let it ponder the questions whether the almighty and provident Guardian of the human race permits anything useless and why, like an experienced steward, He opens the inner chambers of his building to us at this particular time. Such was the opinion put forward by my good friend Thomas Seget, a man of wide learning. Or does God the creator, as I replied, lead mankind, like some growing youngster gradually approaching maturity, step by step from one stage of knowledge to another?		
A2745	does God the creator, as I replied, lead mankind, like some growing youngster gradually approaching maturity, step by step from one stage of knowledge to another?		
A2746	Let the higher philosophy reflect, I repeat, and glance backward to some extent. How far has the knowledge of nature progressed, how much is left, and what may the men of the future expect?		
A2747	We should not anticipate that all of us, equipped with your telescopes, Galileo, will observe them hereafter as a matter of course		
A2752	""" in the interests of that contemplation for which man was created, and adorned and equipped with eyes, he could not remain at rest in the center. On the contrary, he must make an annual journey on this boat, which is our earth, to perform his observations. So surveyors, in measuring inaccessible objects, move from place to place for the purpose of obtaining from the distance between their positions an accurate base line for the triangulation."		
A2755	It remains for me to make an urgent request of you, most illustrious Galileo. Press on vigorously with your observations, and let us know at the very earliest opportunity what results your observations have attained		
A2756	I promised to prepare something in time for the scheduled departure of the couriers, and I kept my pledge.		
A2757	I resolved to advise the reader that everybody has his own preference		
A2758	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said		
A2759	I have never belittled or laid false claim to the ideas of others, when I had none of my own.		
A2760	I have never fawned on others, nor have I been self-effacing if I made some better or prior discovery by my own exertions.		
A2761	I do not think that Galileo, an Italian, has treated me, a German, so well that in return I must flatter him, with injury to the truth or to my deepest convictions.		
A2762	let no one assume that by my readiness to agree with Galileo I propose to deprive others of their right to disagree with him

A2773	discovered an ingenious method of ascertaining to what extent objects are magnified by your instrument		
A2774	Let each employ his own device, and from this partnership may there some day arise an absolutely perfect theory of the distances		
A2775	Hence it occurs to me to compete with you in scrutinizing those small spots first noticed by you in the brighter region. Yet, if this is agreed upon, I hope to get results by my own method of observation, with my back to the moon.		
A2776	a perfect image of the body of the moon will be obtained the size of a large silver coin		
A2777	What you say, then, is correct and in full accord with mathematics.		
A2778	But these suggestions (about cavities that are below the surface and not cut through the mountains) are not so weighty that I would deem them worthy of a stubborn defense, should they be rendered completely untenable by your subsequent reports.		
A2779	you have established most firmly by brilliant observations in full accord with the laws of optics		
A2781	My motive in contradicting Plutarch in this regard may be seen on page 251 of my book.		
A2782	But the flaw in my reasoning is indicated in the margin of the very next page		
A2784	you adduce mathematical arguments against me in favor of Plutarch with brilliant and irrefutable logic		
A2786	These very acute observations of yours do not lack the support of even my own testimony		
A2787	On the basis of this observation I establish the conclusion, identical with yours, yet reached by a different sort of reasoning		
A2788	and once again tell us how it looks to you		
A2789	Mästlin demonstrates this by many observations		
A2790	The next item in your little book is the ingenious and sound proof on page 13 of what I too mentioned casually on page 250, but failed to demonstrate		
A2791	No less ingenious is your arrangement on page 14 inspecting the disk of the moon when its horns first emerge.		
A2792	You support my discussion		
A2793	I doubt, Galileo, whether the cause proposed by you can account for this redness		
A2794	"I should like to ask you, Galileo, whether you are satisfied with the reasons for this effect, as presented by me in my discussion of the process of vision on page 217 and especially on page 221 of my ""Optics."""		
A2797	Now I quote		
A2799	Pythagoras, Plato, and Euclid. Borne aloft by the preeminence of their reason		
A2806	let us establish the astronomy, Galileo, you of Jupiter, and me of the moon.

A2833	After the king had promised her this		
A2834	For a long time the king could not be comforted, and he did not consider taking a second wife		
A2835	There is no other way. The king must remarry, so that we will have a queen.		
A2837	"""God has forbidden that a father should marry his daughter"		
A2838	Nothing good can come from sin, and the kingdom will be pulled along into ruin		
A2839	The daughter was even more horrified when she heard her father's decision.		
A2840	"Hoping to dissuade him from his intentions, she said to him, ""Before I fulfill your wish, I must have three dresses: one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one that glistens like the stars. Further, I must have a cloak put together from a thousand kinds of pelts and fur. Every animal in your kingdom must contribute a piece of its skin for it"		
A2841	"""That will be entirely impossible for him to achieve, and in this way I will divert my father from his wicked thoughts."		
A2843	his huntsmen had to capture all the animals in his entire kingdom and take a piece of skin from each one		
A2845	, she made the decision to run away		
A2846	Then surrendering herself to God, she set forth		
A2847	"Have pity on me and take me with you."" Then they said, ""All-Kinds-of-Fur, you are good for the kitchen. Come with us."		
A2849	she was sent to the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, tended the fire, plucked the poultry, sorted vegetables, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work		
A2850	"""Yes, go ahead. But you have to be back here in a half hour and carry out the ashes."""		
A2852	Taking off her fur cloak, she washed the soot from her hands and face so that her full beauty again came to light.		
A2853	. She put the three dresses from the sun, moon, and stars into a nutshell, put on the cloak of all kinds of fur, blackened her hands and face with soot.		
A2854	the most skilled maidens in his kingdom had to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one that glistened like the stars.		
A2855	she had run back to her cubbyhole, quickly taken off her dress, blackened her hands and face, put on the fur cloak, and was once again All-Kinds-of-Fur.		
A2856	All-Kinds-of-Fur made soup for the king. She made bread soup, and as good as she knew how.		
A2857	she got her golden ring from the cubbyhole and placed it in the bowl that the soup was in		
A2858	"""I must confess that I did not cook it, it was the little furry animal."""		
A2859	", ""May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door."" The cook answered, ""Yes, go ahead. But you have to be back here in a half hour and carry out the ashes."""		
A2860	"""I am good for nothing, except having boots thrown at my head."""		
A2861	"""I am a poor child who no longer has a father or a mother."""		
A2862	"asked the cook for permission to have a look. He answered, ""Yes, but come back in a half hour and cook the bread soup for the king that he likes so much."""		
A2864	She ran to her cubbyhole, turned herself back into a furry animal, and went to the kitchen to make the bread soup. While the cook was upstairs she got the golden spinning wheel and put it in the bowl, so that the soup was prepared on top of it.		
A2865	He had the cook brought before him, who again had to confess that All-Kinds-of-Fur had made the soup.		
A2866	who again had to confess that All-Kinds-of-Fur had made the soup.		
A2868	But because she asked, he allowed her to look in on the ball at the appointed time.		
A2869	And while he was dancing he placed a golden ring on her finger, without her noticing it		
A2870	she tore herself loose and jumped so quickly into the crowd that she disappeared before his eyes.		
A2874	Her golden hair appeared, and she stood there in full splendor, no longer able to hide.		
A2877	we shall never part.		
A2881	the king had promised her this,		
A2890	"Now she thought, ""That will be entirely impossible for him to achieve, and in this way I will divert my father from his wicked thoughts."""		
A2891	And his huntsmen had to capture all the animals in his entire kingdom and take a piece of skin from each one.		
A2893	During the night, while everyone was asleep, she got up and took three things from among her valuables: a golden ring, a little golden spinning wheel, and a little golden reel. She put the three dresses from the sun, moon, and stars into a nutshell, put on the cloak of all kinds of fur, blackened her hands and face with soot. Then surrendering herself to God, she set forth. She walked the entire night until she came to a great forest. Being tired, she sat down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.		
A2894	Then surrendering herself to God, she set forth.		
A2895	The huntsmen followed his command		
A2897	Have pity on me and take me with you		
A2898	Then she was sent to the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, tended the fire, plucked the poultry, sorted vegetables, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work.		
A2901	"""May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door."" The cook answered, ""Yes, go ahead. But you have to be back here in a half hour and carry out the ashes."""		
A2904	Then the cook went away, and All-Kinds-of-Fur made soup for the king. She made bread soup, and as good as she knew how.		
A2905	When it was done, she got her golden ring from the cubbyhole and placed it in the bowl that the soup was in.		
A2906	", ""For sure you let a hair fall into the soup. If that's true, you'll get a beating."""		
A2907	"but don't let a hair fall into it, or in the future there will nothing more for you to eat."""		
A2909	"That is not true, for it was made in a different way, and much better than usual."""		
A2910	"""I must confess that I did not cook it, it was the little furry animal."		
A2911	"When All-Kinds-of-Fur arrived, the king asked, ""Who are you."" ""I am a poor child who no longer has a father or a mother."" He asked further, ""What are you doing in my castle?"" She answered, ""I am good for nothing, except having boots thrown at my head."" He asked further, ""Where did you get the ring that was in the soup?"" She answered, ""I do not know anything about the ring."""		
A2913	She ran to her cubbyhole, quickly washed herself then took from the nut the dress that was as silver as the moon and put it on.		
A2914	She ran to her cubbyhole, turned herself back into a furry animal, and went to the kitchen to make the bread soup		
A2916	"""You are a witch, you furry animal, always putting something in the soup that makes it very good and taste better to the king."""		
A2917	he allowed her to look in on the ball at the appointed time		
A2920	All-Kinds-of-Fur now ran into the kitchen, made the bread soup for the king, and while the cook was away, put the golden reel in it.		
A2925	"Hoping to dissuade him from his intentions, she said to him, ""Before I fulfill your wish, I must have three dresses: one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one that glistens like the stars.

Now she thought, ""That will be entirely impossible for him to achieve, and in this way I will divert my father from his wicked thoughts."""		
A2926	"Now one day it happened that a banquet was being held in the castle, and she said to the cook, ""May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door."""		
A2928	"He ordered the cook to come before him. The cook was terrified when he heard this order, and he said to All-Kinds-of-Fur, ""For sure you let a hair fall into the soup. If that's true, you'll get a beating."""		
A2929	"The cook answered, ""I must confess that I did not cook it, it was the little furry animal."""		
A2930	Some time later there was another banquet, and All-Kinds-of-Fur, as before, asked the cook for permission to have a look.		
A2932	He had the cook brought before him, who again had to confess that All-Kinds-of-Fur had made the soup		
A2933	"""You are a witch, you furry animal, always putting something in the soup that makes it very good and taste better to the king."" But because she asked, he allowed her to look in on the ball at the appointed time."		
A2934	Catching sight of the white finger, he saw the ring that he had put on her while they were dancing.		
A2939	Thus the king could learn nothing, and he had to send her away again.		
A2940	The king danced again with the beautiful maiden, thinking that she had never been so beautiful. And while he was dancing he placed a golden ring on her finger, without her noticing it.		
A2941	king had promised her this,		
A2947	"""May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door."""		
A2949	she got her golden ring from the cubbyhole and placed it in the bowl that the soup was in.		
A2950	While the cook was upstairs she got the golden spinning wheel and put it in the bowl, so that the soup was prepared on top of it.		
A2951	he placed a golden ring on her finger, without her noticing it.		
A2953	he saw the ring that he had put on her while they were dancing.

A2958	Faithful Johannes was his favorite servant, and was so called, because he had been so loyal to him for his whole life long

A2963	Most faithful Johannes		
A2964	After faithful Johannes had once more given his promise to the old king about this		
A2965	"I will not be able to close my eyes in peace if you do not promise to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster father."" Faithful Johannes answered, ""I will not forsake him,"		
A2966	"""I will surely keep my promise, and will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him, even if it should cost me my life."""		
A2968	"""There is something in there that would frighten you."""		
A2969	I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber.		
A2970	"""Misfortune has befallen us, dear Lord."		
A2973	You are my most faithful Johannes.		
A2974	"Finally he thought of a way, and said to the king, ""Everything which she has about her is of gold -- tables, chairs, dishes, cups, bowls, and household implements. Among your treasures are five tons of gold. Have the royal goldsmiths fashion one ton into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts, and strange animals. She will like these things, and we will go there with them and to try our luck."		
A2975	"""Oh, whose portrait is that beautiful picture?"" ""That is the Princess of the Golden Roof"		
A2976	"""That is the Princess of the Golden Roof,"""		
A2977	"""I am only the servant of a rich merchant. The things I have here are not to be compared with those my master has in his ship. They are the most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in gold."""		
A2978	"""I have seen the entire castle, and I want to know what is in this room as well."""		
A2979	"You must help me."" The faithful servant thought to himself for a long time how to approach the matter, for it was difficult even to come into view of the king's daughter. Finally he thought of a way,"		
A2980	This made her all the more curious and desirous,		
A2981	curious		
A2983	I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are.		
A2984	Many hours went by while she was looking at everything,		
A2987	When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will leap up into the air with him, and he will never see his bride again.

A2991	"""I will save my master, even if it brings destruction on myself."""		
A2992	Who knows what good he may have done? Leave him alone. He is my most faithful Johannes		
A2993	"The young king saw what had happened, and not knowing why faithful Johannes had done it, grew angry and shouted, ""Throw him into prison."""		
A2994	The next morning faithful Johannes was condemned and led to the gallows.		
A2995	"""Throw him into prison."""		
A2996	Everyone who is condemned to die is permitted before his end to say one last thing.		
A2997	"May I too have this right?"" ""Yes,"" answered the king. ""You are granted this right."""		
A2999	"""I have been unjustly condemned, and have always been loyal to you,"

A3005	"Oh, my most faithful Johannes, pardon! Pardon! Bring him down."""		
A3007	"""Oh, I have rewarded him very badly for his great loyalty."""		
A3008	This caused the king and the queen great grief,		
A3009	"""Oh, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes."""		
A3010	"""For you I will give up everything I have in the world."""		
A3011	The king was horrified when he heard that he would have to kill his own dearest children, but he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty, and how he had died for him, then drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children's heads.		
A3012	he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty

A3025	"""Then I will die in comfort and peace"		
A3027	After faithful Johannes had once more given his promise to the old king about this, the latter said no more, but laid his head on his pillow and died.

A3037	The king summoned all the goldsmiths, and they had to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were prepared.		
A3039	Faithful Johannes had the king stay behind on the ship and wait for him.		
A3040	This made her all the more curious and desirous		
A3044	"""I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are. If I have tricked you into coming with me, it is only because of my great love for you. The first time I saw your portrait, I fell to the ground unconscious."""

A3047	"""I know more than that. Even if the horse is killed, still the young king will not keep his bride."

""Yes,"" answered the king. ""You are granted this right."""		
A3063	"Faithful Johannes said, ""I have been unjustly condemned, and have always been loyal to you, and he related how he had heard the conversation of the ravens at sea, and how he had had to do all these things in order to save his master."		
A3066	"Every time that he looked at it he wept, saying, ""Oh, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes."""		
A3067	when the queen was at church		
A3068	"The king cried, ""For you I will give up everything I have in the world."""		
A3069	"He said to the king, ""Your loyalty shall not go unrewarded,"" then taking the children's heads, he put them on again, then rubbed the wounds with their blood, at which they became immediately whole again, and jumped about and went on playing as if nothing had happened."		
A3070	"When she entered, he said to her, ""Have you been praying in the church?"""		
A3071	"The queen turned pale, and her heart filled with terror, but she said, ""We owe it to him for his great loyalty."""		
A3073	"""Why do you never open this one for me?"""		
A3074	"The king answered ""I have seen the entire castle, and I want to know what is in this room as well."" And he was about to break open the door by force."		
A3075	"""If I do not go in, it will be my certain downfall. I shall have no rest day or night until I have seen inside with my own eyes. I shall not leave here until you have unlocked the door."""		
A3076	But what good did it do? The king stood on tiptoes and saw the portrait over faithful Johannes's shoulder.		
A3078	The king summoned all the goldsmiths, and they had to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were prepared. When everything had been loaded on board a ship, faithful Johannes disguised himself as a merchant, and the king had to do the same thing in order to make himself quite unrecognizable. Then they sailed across the sea, and sailed on until they came to the city where the Princess of the Golden Roof lived.		
A3079	"Faithful Johannes had the king stay behind on the ship and wait for him. ""Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,"" he said. ""Therefore see that everything is in order. Have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated."""		
A3080	"She was just turning around to carry away the sparkling water when she saw the stranger and asked who he was. He answered, ""I am a merchant,"" opening his apron, and letting her look in."

But do not show him the last chamber in the long gallery, which contains the portrait of the Princess of the Golden Roof.

A3102	"""I will not forsake him,"		
A3104	faithful Johannes told the young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed

A3106	will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him

A3109	Then he took him everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches and the magnificent chambers		
A3111	"The young king noticed that faithful Johannes always walked past this one door, and said, ""Why do you never open this one for me?"" He replied, ""There is something in there that would frighten you."" The king answered ""I have seen the entire castle, and I want to know what is in this room as well."" And he was about to break open the door by force. Faithful Johannes held him back, saying, ""I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber.

A3112	"""I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber."		
A3113	It could bring great misfortune on you and on me.		
A3114	Faithful Johannes saw that there was no other way		
A3117	fter seeing the girl's portrait, which was so magnificent and glistened with gold and precious stones, he fell unconscious to the ground.		
A3118	"Faithful Johannes picked him up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought, ""Misfortune has befallen us, dear Lord. How will it end?"" Then he strengthened the king with wine, until he regained consciousness."		
A3119	"The king's first words were, ""Oh, whose portrait is that beautiful picture?"" ""That is the Princess of the Golden Roof,"" answered faithful Johannes."		
A3120	"The king continued, ""My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they would not be able to express it. I will risk my life to win her. You are my most faithful Johannes. You must help me."		
A3122	The faithful servant thought to himself for a long time how to approach the matter, for it was difficult even to come into view of the king's daughter.		
A3123	"Finally he thought of a way, and said to the king, ""Everything which she has about her is of gold -- tables, chairs, dishes, cups, bowls, and household implements.

Have the royal goldsmiths fashion one ton into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts, and strange animals. She will like these things, and we will go there with them and to try our luck		
A3126	"Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,"" he said. ""Therefore see that everything is in order. Have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated."		
A3128	"""Oh, what beautiful golden things,"" she cried, putting her buckets down and looking at the golden wares one after the other. Then the girl said, ""The princess must see these things. She takes such great pleasure in golden things, that she will buy all you have."""		
A3134	"But faithful Johannes remained with the helmsman and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying, ""Set all the sails and fly like a bird in the air."		
A3135	Inside, the king showed her the golden vessels, every one of them, and also the wild beasts and strange animals		
A3136	After she had looked at the last item, she thanked the merchant and wanted to go home,		
A3139	"Taking her by the hand, the king said, ""I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are."		
A3140	"Taking her by the hand, the king said, ""I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are"		
A3143	Now it so happened that while they were sailing onward on the high sea, faithful Johannes, who was sitting at the front of the ship making music, saw three ravens flying through the air towards them		
A3144	"One cried ""Oh, he is carrying home the Princess of the Golden Roof."" ""Yes,"" replied the second, ""but he doesn't have her yet."" The third one said, ""Yes, he has her. She is sitting beside him in the ship."" Then the first one began again, crying, ""What good will that do him? When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will leap up into the air with him, and he will never see his bride again."" The second one spoke, ""Is there no escape?"" ""Oh, yes, if someone else quickly mounts it, takes the gun from its saddlebag, and shoots the horse dead, then young king will be rescued. But who knows that? And if anyone does know it, and tells it to the king, he will be turned to stone from his toes to his knees."""		
A3147	"Then the second raven said, ""I know more than that. Even if the horse is killed, still the young king will not keep his bride. When they enter the castle together, a ready-made wedding shirt will be lying there on a platter. It will appear to be woven of gold and silver, but it is nothing but sulfur and pitch. If he puts it on, it will burn him to the very marrow and bone."""		
A3148	"""Oh, yes,"" replied the second raven. ""If anyone with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it up, the young king will be saved. But what good will that do? If anyone knows it and tells it to the king, half his body will become stone, from his knees to his heart."""		
A3149	If anyone with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it up, the young king will be saved. But what good will that do? If anyone knows it and tells it to the king, half his body will become stone, from his knees to his heart		
A3150	When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will leap up into the air with him, and he will never see his bride again		
A3151	if someone else quickly mounts it, takes the gun from its saddlebag, and shoots the horse dead, then young king will be rescued		
A3152	"""I know more than that. Even if the horse is killed, still the young king will not keep his bride. When they enter the castle together, a ready-made wedding shirt will be lying there on a platter. It will appear to be woven of gold and silver, but it is nothing but sulfur and pitch. If he puts it on, it will burn him to the very marrow and bone."		
A3153	"""I know still more. Even if the wedding shirt is burned up, still the young king will not have his bride. After the wedding, when the dancing begins and the young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead. If someone does not lift her up and draw three drops of blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows that reveals it, his entire body will turn to stone, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet."""		
A3154	"Then the third raven said, ""I know still more. Even if the wedding shirt is burned up, still the young king will not have his bride.

But if anyone who knows that reveals it, his entire body will turn to stone, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet."""		
A3156	From that time forth he became quiet and sad, for if he concealed what he had heard from his master, it would bring misfortune to the king, but if he revealed it to him, then he himself would have to sacrifice his life		
A3158	When they landed, what the raven foretold did indeed happen		
A3159	He was about to mount it when faithful Johannes pushed in front of him, quickly jumped onto the horse, drew the gun from its saddlebag, and shot the horse.		
A3160	faithful Johannes pushed in front of him, quickly jumped onto the horse, drew the gun from its saddlebag, and shot the horse		
A3162	faithful Johannes,		
A3163	faithful Johannes pushed him away, seized it with gloves, carried it quickly to the fire, and burned it up.		
A3164	pushed him away, seized it with gloves, carried it quickly to the fire, and burned it up		
A3166	Faithful Johannes was watchful and looked into her face		
A3168	He ran quickly to her, picked her up and carried her into a chamber. He laid her down, then knelt and sucked three drops of blood from her right breast, and spat them out. Immediately she breathed again and regained consciousness		
A3170	faithful Johannes		
A3173	"""Yes,"" answered the king. ""You are granted this right."""		
A3176	This caused the king and the queen great grief		
A3177	I have rewarded him very badly for his great loyalty.		
A3178	"He then ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom next to his bed. Every time that he looked at it he wept, saying, ""Oh, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes."		
A3180	, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes.		
A3181	"Then the stone began to speak and said, ""You can bring me back to life again if you will in return give up what is dearest to you."" The king cried, ""For you I will give up everything I have in the world."" The stone continued, ""If you will cut off the heads of your two children with your own hand, then sprinkle their blood on me, I shall be restored to life."""		
A3182	"The king cried, ""For you I will give up everything I have in the world."		
A3183	The king was horrified when he heard that he would have to kill his own dearest children, but he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty, and how he had died for him, then drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children's heads. And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, it returned to life, and faithful Johannes stood before him, again healthy and well.		
A3185	"When he saw the queen coming he hid faithful Johannes and the two children in a large chest. When she entered, he said to her, ""Have you been praying in the church?"" ""Yes, she answered, ""but I have constantly been thinking about faithful Johannes and what misfortune has befallen him because of us."""		
A3186	"""but I have constantly been thinking about faithful Johannes and what misfortune has befallen him because of us."""		
A3188	"""We owe it to him for his great loyalty."		
A3189	", ""God be praised!"		
A3190	Faithful Johannes has been saved, and we have our little sons again as well.		
A3191	Faithful Johannes has been saved,		
A3192	He told her how everything had happened		
A3193	have been unjustly condemned, and have always been loyal to you,		
A3199	"""is brother not to have one too?"		
A3201	kindly,		
A3207	pious wife		
A3208	the woman prayed for them day and night		
A3222	and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest		
A3223	gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest		
A3224	"""is brother not to have one too"		
A3227	"she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, ""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted."		
A3229	Marlene stood by crying and crying		
A3230	"""Here is the golden chain for you. Now sing that song again for me."		
A3231	", ""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" ""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."""		
A3232	"""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" ""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."""		
A3234	With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully		
A3235	"""Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks."""		
A3236	He threw the shoes down to her.		
A3240	"""Here is the golden chain for you. Now sing that song again for me."""		
A3244	So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white scarf out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen		
A3252	"""Marlene, why are you crying? Your brother will certainly come back."""		
A3255	Marlene, however, was as happy and contented as if her brother were still alive. And she went merrily into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.		
A3256	My mother, she killed me, Then one of them stopped working. My father, he ate me, Then two more stopped working and listened, My sister Marlene, Then four more stopped, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Now only eight only were chiseling, Laid them beneath Now only five, the juniper tree, Now only one, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.		
A3259	My mother, she killed me, The mother stopped her ears and shut her eyes, not wanting to see or hear, but there was a roaring in her ears like the fiercest storm, and her eyes burned and flashed like lightning. My father, he ate me,		
A3261	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.		
A3263	"My mother killed me. ""I wish I were a thousand fathoms beneath the earth, so I would not have to hear that!"" My father, he ate me, Then the woman fell down as if she were dead. My sister Marlene, ""Oh,"" said Marlene, ""I too will go out and see if the bird will give me something."" Then she went out. Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, He threw the shoes down to her. Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I."		
A3264	"No,"" said the woman, jumping to her feet and with her hair standing up like flames of fire, ""I feel as if the world were coming to an end. I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better."" And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death."		
A3265	Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.		
A3268	Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree		
A3271	gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest.		
A3274	"""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"""		
A3276	My mother, she killed me,		
A3277	My father, he ate me,		
A3279	My mother, she killed me, My father, he ate me, My sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree,		
A3280	My mother, she killed me, Then one of them stopped working. My father, he ate me,

A3282	the juniper tree,		
A3283	Here is the golden chain for you.		
A3285	"""There, bird,"""		
A3286	We will cook him into stew.		
A3288	took a beam and lifted the stone up		
A3293	the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death.		
A3294	"I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better."""		
A3297	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf,		
A3298	Laid them beneath the juniper tree,		
A3299	"""You shall not have one before your brother."""		
A3300	aid that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen.		
A3307	There was a little table with a white tablecloth and seven little plates, and each plate had a spoon, and there were seven knives and forks and seven mugs as well. Against the wall there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with snow-white sheets.		
A3309	", ""If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want."""		
A3316	The dear child was dead, and she remained dead. They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days.		
A3317	Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain, and one of them always stayed with it and watched over her.		
A3319	"""We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."""		
A3321	the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him the coffin.		
A3322	but let her continue to sleep there in the bed		
A3323	The unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and let her do up the new lace		
A3325	So she kept house for them. Every morning they went into the mountains looking for ore and gold, and in the evening when they came back home their meal had to be ready.		
A3326	"""If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want"		
A3329	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? To this the mirror answered: You, my queen, are fairest of all.		
A3330	for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.		
A3334	until she had no peace day and night.		
A3338	The poor child was now all alone in the great forest, and she was so afraid that she just looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do		
A3339	Because she was so hungry and thirsty Snow-White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate, and from each mug she drank a drop of wine.		
A3340	She remained lying in it, entrusted herself to God, and fell asleep.		
A3341	Soon afterward she had a little daughter who was as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood, and therefore they called her Little Snow-White		
A3342	They were so happy, that they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed		
A3343	"The next morning Snow-White woke up, and when she saw the seven dwarfs she was frightened. But they were friendly and asked, ""What is your name?"" ""My name is Snow-White,"" she answered."		
A3345	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? It answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3346	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3347	This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie		
A3349	At last she thought of something. Coloring her face, she disguised herself as an old peddler woman, so that no one would recognize her.		
A3351	The mirror answered once again: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3353	When she heard that, all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow-White had come back to life.		
A3354	Then with the art of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisoned comb. Then she disguised herself, taking the form of a different old woman.		
A3356	The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door.		
A3357	After they had agreed on the purchase		
A3358	The mirror answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3361	"""Are you afraid of poison?"" asked the old woman. ""Look, I'll cut the apple in two. You eat the red half, and I shall eat the white half."""		
A3363	"The queen looked at her with a gruesome stare, laughed loudly, and said, ""White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony wood! This time the dwarfs cannot awaken you."""		
A3367	"Then he said to the dwarfs, ""Let me have the coffin. I will give you anything you want for it."""		
A3368	"But the dwarfs answered, ""We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."""		
A3370	The mirror answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But the young queen is a thousand times fairer than you.		
A3371	but she found no peace		
A3372	She had to go and see the young queen		
A3373	When she arrived she recognized Snow-White, and terrorized, she could only stand there without moving		
A3374	"As she was thus lamenting, someone called out to her, ""What is the matter with you, princess? Your crying would turn a stone to pity."""		
A3376	"""Be still and stop crying,"" answered the frog. I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring back your plaything?"""

And because I was crying so much, the frog brought it back, and because he insisted, I promised him that he could be my companion, but I didn't think that he could leave his water. But now he is just outside the door and wants to come in."""		
A3386	"The king said, ""What you have promised, you must keep. Go and let the frog in."""

A3440	comets are carried with very eccentric motions through all parts of the heavens indifferently,		
A3441	Bodies projected in our air suffer no resistance but from the air. Withdraw the air, as is done in Mr. Boyle's vacuum, and the resistance ceases;		
A3442	The six primary planets are revolved about the sun in circles concentric with the sun, and with motions directed towards the same parts, and almost in the same plane. Ten moons are revolved about the earth, Jupiter and Saturn, in circles concentric with them, with the same direction of motion, and nearly in the planes of the orbits of those planets;		
A3443	This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the centres of other like systems, these, being formed by the like wise counsel, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all the other systems: and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their gravity, fall on each other mutually, he hath placed those systems at immense distances one from another.		
A3444	This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called Lord God παντοκράτωρ, or Universal Ruler; for God is a relative word, and has a respect to servants; and Deity is the dominion of God not over his own body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of the world, but over servants.

A3457	nor are we furnished with that sufficiency of experiments which is required to an accurate determination and demonstration of the laws		
A3458	but the rotation of the sun and planets about their axes, which ought to correspond with the motions of their vortices, recede far from all these proportions.		
A3459	The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, are governed by the same laws with the motions of the planets, and can by no means be accounted for by the hypothesis of vortices

A3466	To practical mechanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.		
A3467	But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accurate is called geometrical, what is less so, is called mechanical.		
A3468	He that works with less accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work with perfect accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all; for the description if right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to mechanics.		
A3469	To describe right lines and circles are problems, but not geometrical problems. The solution of these problems is required from mechanics; and by geometry the use of them, when so solved, is shown; and it is the glory of geometry that from those few principles, brought from without, it is able to produce so many things.		
A3474	In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that its becoming public is owing; for when he had obtained of me my demonstrations of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to communicate the same to the Royal Society, who afterwards, by their kind encouragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them.		
A3475	I heartily beg that what I have here done may be read with candour; and that the defects in a subject so difficult be not so much reprehended as kindly supplied, and investigated by new endeavours of my readers.		
A3480	I hope the principles here laid down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of philosophy

A3492	For riches do not protect the man who in wantonness has kicked the mighty altar of Justice into obscurity.		
A3495	The gods are not blind to men with blood upon their hands.  In the end the black Spirits of Vengeance bring to obscurity that one who has prospered in unrighteousness andwear down his fortunes by reverse. Once a man is among the unseen, there is no more help for him.		
A3499	Convicted for robbery and for theft as well,he has lost the plunder and has razed in utter destruction his father's house and even the land.  The sons of Priam have paid a twofold penalty for their sins.		
A3503	But Priam's city has learned, in her old age, an altered strain, and now, I trust, wails a loud song, full of lamentation, calling Paris “evil-wed”; for she has born the burden of a life in which everything was destroyed, a life full of lamentation because ofthe wretched slaughter of her sons		
A3506	But Righteousness shines in smoke-begrimed dwellingsand esteems the virtuous man. From gilded mansions, where men's hands are foul, she departs with averted eyes and makes her way to pure homes; she does not worship the powerof wealth stamped counterfeit by the praise of men, and she guides all things to their proper end.

For he is no slight shield of confidence to me. Here lies the man who did me wrong, plaything of each Chryseis at Ilium;and here she lies, his captive, and auguress, and concubine, his oracular faithful whore, yet equally familiar with the seamen's benches.  The pair has met no undeserved fate.  For he lies thus; while she, who, like a swan,has sung her last lament in death, lies here, his beloved; but to me she has brought for my bed an added relish of delight.		
A3524	The spoiler is despoiled, the slayer pays penalty.

At last the hour has come when I can say that the gods who avenge mortal men look down from on high upon the crimes of earth.Now that, to my joy, I behold this man lying here in a robe spun by the Avenging Spirits and making full payment for the deeds contrived in craft by his father's hand.		
A3526	I tell you in the hour of justice that you yourself, be sure of that, will not escape the people's curses and death by stoning at their hand.		
A3528	It would not be like men of Argos to cringe before a man as low as you.		
A3530	And there, with judges of your case and speeches of persuasive charm, we shall find means to release you completely from your labors.		
A3533	although you are a god, you have stolen away a man that killed his mother. What is there here that anyone shall call just?		
A3534	They do such things, the younger gods, who rule, wholly beyond justice,		
A3537	For marriage ordained by fate for a man and a woman is greater than an oath and guarded by Justice		
A3538	But the goddess Pallas will oversee the pleadings in this case.		
A3541	Here I will keep watch and await the result of my trial.		
A3545	We claim to be just and upright.		
A3546	but whoever sins, as this man has, and hides his blood-stained hands, as avengers of bloodshed we appear against him to the end, presenting ourselves as upright witnesses for the dead.		
A3549	You want to be called just rather than to act justly.		
A3550	I say that oaths must not win victory for injustice.		
A3551	relying on the justice of your case		
A3553	You judge whether I acted justly or not		
A3554	The matter is too great, if any mortal thinks to pass judgment on it		
A3555	I will select judges of homicide bound by oath, and I will establish this tribunal for all time.		
A3556	Summon your witnesses and proofs, sworn evidence to support your case; and I will return when I have chosen the best of my citizens, for them to decide this matter truly, after they take an oath that they will pronounce no judgment contrary to justice.		
A3558	respect the altar of Justice and do not, looking to profit, dishonor it by spurning with godless foot		
A3559	or punishment will come upon you.		
A3560	He wrecks the happiness of his earlier life on the reef of Justice, and he perishes unwept, unseen.		
A3561	just or not		
A3562	Learn how strong this plea of justice is		
A3565	as you judge the first trial		
A3566	In the future, even as now, this court of judges will always exist for the people of Aegeus. And this Hill of Ares, the seat and camp of the Amazons,when they came with an army in resentment against Theseus, and in those days built up this new citadel with lofty towers to rival his, and sacrificed to Ares, from which this rock takes its name, the Hill of Ares:25on this hill, the reverence of the citizens, and fear, its kinsman, will hold them back from doing wrong by day and night alike, so long as they themselves do not pollute the laws with evil streams; if you stain clear water with filth, you will never find a drink.		
A3567	Neither anarchy nor tyranny		
A3568	I establish this tribunal, untouched by greed, worthy of reverence, quick to anger, awake on behalf of those who sleep, a guardian of the land.		
A3569	the numbers of the casts are equal		
A3571	just		
A3572	unjust		
A3573	justly		
A3574	Peace		
A3577	But the balance of Justice keeps watch:  swiftly it descends on those in the light; sometimes pain waits for those who linger on the frontier of twilight; and others are claimed by strengthless night.		
A3580	judge		
A3588	“For a word of hate let a word of hate be said,”Justice cries out as she exacts the debt, “and for a murderous stroke let a murderous stroke be paid.”  “Let it be done to him as he does,” says the age-old wisdom.		
A3591	After injustice I demand justice as my right.		
A3595	O you gods, judge rightly the plea of right!		
A3597	For truly the injustice of him who has unjustly transgressed the sovereign majesty of Zeus lies on the ground trampled under foot.		
A3601	Every word of mine has been uttered in justice.		
A3602	the radiant light of freedom.		
A3605	I judge you victor:		
A3608	justice came at last in crushing retribution		
A3615	Such is his offence; for this he is bound		
A3618	A strangely potent tie is kinship, and companionship as well.		
A3620	Alas, Prometheus, I groan for your sufferings.		
A3621	what shameful torture I am racked		
A3629	For myself, I would not have desired to see them; and now that I see them, I am pained in my heart.		
A3631	there is none to whom I should  pay greater respect than to you		
A3633	until I taught them to discern the risings of the stars and their settings, which are difficult to distinguish. Yes, and numbers, too, chiefest of sciences,I invented for them, and the combining of letters, creative mother of the Muses' arts, with which to hold all things in memory.  I, too, first brought brute beasts beneath the yoke to be subject to the collar and the pack-saddle, so that they might bear in men's stead theirheaviest burdens; and  to the chariot I harnessed horses and made them obedient to the rein, to be an image of wealth and luxury. It was I and no one else who invented the mariner's flaxen-winged car that roams the sea		
A3634	I showed them how to mix soothing remedies with which they now ward off all their disorders.  And I marked out many ways by which they might read the future,and among dreams I first discerned which are destined to come true; and voices baffling interpretation I explained to them, and signs from chance meetings.  The flight of crook-taloned birds I distinguished clearly— which by nature are auspicious,which sinister—their various modes of life,		
A3635	I cleared their vision to discern signs from flames,which were obscure before this		
A3636	Now as to the benefits to men that lay concealed beneath the earth—bronze, iron, silver, and gold—who would claim to have discovered them before me?		
A3637	every art possessed by man comes from Prometheus.		
A3639	nor may I be slow to approach the gods, with holy sacrifices of oxen slain,		
A3640	But I shudderas I look on you, racked by infinite tortures.		
A3641	not weaving riddles, but in simple language, since it is right to speak openly to friends.		
A3643	for I consider false words to be the foulest sickness.		
A3645	that to marry in one's own class is far the best—a poor man should not desire to marry among those who are pampered by riches, or who are mighty in pride of birth.		
A3646	I know the fact and the means		
A3648	I speak what shall be brought to pass and, moreover, my own desire.		
A3649	Chorus How is it that you are not afraid to utter such taunts? Prometheus Why should I fear since I am fated not to die? Chorus But he might inflict on you an ordeal even more bitter than this. Prometheus Let him, for all I care!  I am prepared for anything.		
A3654	But ever-ageing Time teaches all things.		
A3657	But if you will not be won to belief by my words,think of what a tempest and a towering wave of woe shall break upon you past escape.  First, the Father will shatter this jagged cliff with thunder and lightning-flame, and will entomb your frame, while the rock shall still hold you clasped in its embrace.But when you have completed a long stretch of time, you shall come back again to the light.  Then indeed the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great rents and feast his fillupon your liver until it is black with gnawing.		
A3658	With him I am content to suffer any fate;		
A3659	for I have learned to detest traitors, and there is no pestI abhor more than this.		
A3662	You must aid, too, your children, and Mother Earth, your beloved nurse.  For welcoming all the distress of your childhood, when you were young and crept upon her kind soil, she raised you to inhabit her and bear the shield,and to prove yourselves faithful in this time of need.		
A3663	Hurry each of you to the battlements and the gates of our towered walls! Rush with all your armor! Fill the parapets and take your positions on the platforms of the towers.  Stand your ground bravely where the gates open out,and do not be afraid of this crowd of foreigners. God will bring it to a good end.		
A3665	for a State that prospers pays honors to its gods		
A3674	I vow that, if things go well and the city is saved,the citizens shall redden the gods' altars with the blood of sheep and sacrifice bulls to the gods—this is my vow—and offer trophies, while I will crown their holy temples with the spoil of the enemy's spear-pierced garments.		
A3678	he is full noble andreveres the throne of Honor and detests proud speech.		
A3679	he rises up in a just cause, to battle for his city!		
A3690	If only they would get from the gods what they wish for, because of those unholy boasts of theirs, then surely they would perish in utter ruin and misery.		
A3691	If the gods are willing, what I speak may prove true!		
A3694	What justice is it to drain dry the font of your existence?		
A3695	I anticipate no dishonorable death.		
A3700	Gods, hear our just prayers and fulfil them, that the city may have good fortune!		
A3702	She claims to be Justice, as the lettering indicates, “I will bring this man back and he will have his city and move freely in his father's halls.”		
A3709	And yet any victory, even a cowardly one, is nonetheless held in honor by God.		
A3729	as the city and justice, too,  approves.		
A3733	Zeus the Savior, invoked third2, the guardian of the habitations of righteous men		
A3734	Butthe thronging swarm of violent men born of Aegyptus, should they set foot upon this marshy land,  drive them seaward—and with them their swift ship—and there may they encounter a cruel sea with thunder, lightning, and rain-charged winds,and perish by the tempest's buffeting blasts, if they ever lay their hands on us, their cousins		
A3737	gods of our race, hear, and regard with favor the cause of righteousness		
A3739	righteous		
A3740	Even for those who flee hard-pressed from war there is an altar,a shelter against harm through respect for the powers of heaven.		
A3745	My children, you must be prudent.		
A3747	Stronger than a castle is an altar—an impenetrable shield.		
A3749	and reveal nothing impious in your peaceful eyes, from your respectful face		
A3752	O Zeus, have pity upon our troubles lest we are ruined.		
A3753	May he have pity indeed, and stand by ready to defend.		
A3755	For such an act, not even in Hades, after death, shall he escape arraignment for outrage.There also among the dead, so men tell, another Zeus holds a last judgment upon misdeeds.		
A3759	But Justice protects her champions.		
A3761	Indeed,may Justice, daughter of Zeus the Apportioner, Justice who protects the suppliant, look upon our flight that it bring no mischief in its wake.		
A3762	For myself, I will pledge no promise before I have communicated these events to all the citizens.		
A3765	ake Justice as your ally, and render judgment for the cause deemed righteous by the gods		
A3766	I will not do this thing without the consent of my people,		
A3767	to the wicked their wrongdoing and to the godly their works of righteousness.		
A3768	Surely you cannot think there is no need of salutary counsel?		
A3770	Do not see your suppliant dragged, in spite of justice, from the images of the gods,like a horse by the bridle, and see rude hands laid upon my fine-woven robes.		
A3773	And yet the wrath of Zeus who guards the suppliant compels my reverence; for supreme among mortals is the fear of him.		
A3776	all goes well on the part of the citizens.  Decrees, carrying full authority, have been passed.		
A3777	to what end has the decision been carried, and to what course does the majority of the people's votes incline?		
A3779	For the air bristled with right hands held aloft as, in full vote, they ratified this resolution into law		
A3781	Hearing these words, the Argive people, waiting for no proclamation of crier, voted by uplifted hand that this should be so.		
A3782	It was the Pelasgian people, won readily to assent, who heard the subtle windings of his speech		
A3784	for they had compassion for us		
A3785	and cast a vote in our favor		
A3788	May the people who control the state guard its privileges free from fear—a prudent government counselling wisely for the public prosperity.		
A3789	Since reverence for parents stands written third among the statutes of Justice, to whom honor supreme is due.		
A3790	he who dishonors the gods will suffer punishment.		
A3796	Come death, death be my doom,before the marriage-bed!  How can I yet find some means of escape to deliver me from marriage?		
A3802	and destroy you.		
A3809	But to this purpose a decree has been passed by the unanimous resolve of the people of the State, never, under compulsion, to surrender this association of women.		
A3812	Why wait for others of higher authority?		
A3820	Ah! I remember that I wasdelighted in soul when Cleon had to disgorge those five talents;2 I wasin ecstasy and I love the Knights for this deed;		
A3826	it is to me alone that the gods have entrusted the duty oftreating with the Lacedaemonians.		
A3830	Take these eight drachmae and go and conclude a truce with theLacedaemonians for me, my wife and my children; I leave you free,my dear citizens, to send out embassies and to stand gaping in the air.		
A3831	was hurrying to bring your treaty of truce, but some old dotardsfrom Acharnae34 got scent of the thing;		
A3832	This last is a truce of thirty years, both on sea and land. DICAEOPOLIS Oh! by Bacchus! what a bouquet!  It has the aroma of nectar andambrosia;		
A3834	It is well! Oh, mighty Bacchus, it is with joy that, freed frommilitary duty, I and all mine perform this solemn rite and offerthee this sacrifice; grant that I may keep the rural Dionysiawithout hindrance and that this truce of thirty years may bepropitious for me.		
A3835	h, Phales,47 companion of the orgiesof Bacchus, night reveller, god of adultery, friend of young men, thesepast six48 years I have not been able to invoke thee.		
A3844	I shall not please,but I shall say what is true.		
A3845	But come (there are only friends whohear me), why accuse the Laconians of all our woes?		
A3852	In cautioning you againstsuch wiles, the poet has done you great service as well asin forcing you to understand what is really the democraticprinciple.		
A3853	In cautioning you againstsuch wiles, the poet has done you great service as well asin forcing you to understand what is really the democraticprinciple.  Thus, the strangers, who came to pay their tributes,wanted to see this great poet, who had dared to speak the truth toAthens.		
A3859	Oh! my well-beloved, thou object of my long regrets, thou art hereat last then, thou, after whom the comic poets sigh, thou, who artdear to Morychus.103  Slaves, hither with the stove and the bellows.Look at this charming eel, that returns to us after six long yearsof absence.		
A3860	You see, citizens, you see the good fortune which this man owes tohis prudence, to his profound wisdom.  You see how, since he hasconcluded peace, he buys what is useful in the household and good toeat hot.		
A3861	Oh, Peace! companion of fair Aphrodite and of the sweet Graces,how charming are thy features and yet I never knew it!  Would that Erosmight join me to thee, Eros, crowned with roses as Zeuxis112 shows him tous!		
A3862	Women, children, have you not heard?  Faith! do you not heed theherald?  Quick! let the hares boil and roast merrily;		
A3867	You triumph then, brave champion; thine is the wine-skin! DICAEOPOLIS Follow me, singing Triumph! Triumph! CHORUS Aye!  we will sing of thee, thee and thy sacred wine-skin, and we all,as we follow thee, will repeat in thine honour, Triumph, Triumph!		
A3870	Thus, the strangers, who came to pay their tributes,wanted to see this great poet, who had dared to speak the truth toAthens.		
A3874	ll good things flow towards him unsought.  Never will I welcomethe god of war in my house;		
A3876	Let us save the ship of state, which just at present none seems able either to sail or row.		
A3878	May the gods grant success to my plans!		
A3885	I want all to have a share of everything and all property to be in common; there will no longer be either rich or poor; no longer shall we see one man harvesting vast tracts of land, while another has not ground enough to be buried in, nor one man surround himself with a whole army of slaves, while another has not a single attendant; I intend that there shall only be one and the same condition of life for all.		
A3886	shall begin by making land, money, everything that is private property, common to all. Then we shall live on this common wealth, which we shall take care to administer with wise thrift.		
A3887	The poor will no longer be obliged to work; each will have all that he needs, bread, salt fish, cakes, tunics, wine, chaplets and chick-pease;		
A3888	The ugliest and the most flat-nosed will be side by side with the most charming, and to win the latter's favours, a man will first have to get into the former.		
A3889	Athens will become nothing more than a single house, in which everything will belong to everyone; so that everybody will be able to go from one house to the other at pleasure.		
A3910	besides, who will know better than a mother how to forward provisions to the front?		
A3918	The Prytanes started the discussion of measures closely concerning the safety of the state; immediately, that blear-eyed fellow, the son of Neoclides, was the first to mount the platform. Then the folk shouted with their loudest voice, “What! he dares to speak, and that, too, when the safety of the state is concerned, and he a man who has not known how to save even his own eyebrows!”		
A3920	Then he added that the women lend each other clothes, trinkets of gold and silver, drinking-cups, and not before witnesses too, but all by themselves, and that they return everything with exactitude without ever cheating each other;whereas, according to him, we are ever ready to deny the loans we have effected.		
A3924	Blepyrus Ah! but I hate compulsion. Chremes But if it is for the public good, let us resign ourselves.		
A3925	It's an old saying that our absurdest and maddest decrees always somehow turn out for our good.		
A3927	Now tell us how we can be of service to you, so that we may show you our obedience, for we have never seen a cleverer woman than you.		
A3930	There will be no more thieves, nor envious people, no more rags nor misery, no more abuse and no more prosecutions and law-suits.		
A3931	Praxagora There will be no more thieves, nor envious people, no more rags nor misery, no more abuse and no more prosecutions and law-suits.		
A3932	Devote the fecundity of your mind to the public weal; adorn the citizens' lives with a thousand enjoyments and teach them to seize every favourable opportunity. Devise some ingenious method to secure the much-needed salvation of Athens;		
A3933	but let neither your acts nor your words recall anything of the past, for 'tis only innovations that please.		
A3934	Praxagora I believe my ideas are good, but what I fear is that the public will cling to the old customs and refuse to accept my reforms. Blepyrus Have no fear about that. Love of novelty and disdain for traditions, these are the dominating principles among us.		
A3935	his is what I was going to say: I shall begin by making land, money, everything that is private property, common to all. Then we shall live on this common wealth, which we shall take care to administer with wise thrift.		
A3940	Blepyrus There will be no more thieves then, eh? Praxagora Why steal, if you have a share of everything?		
A3941	Even if you sleep outdoors there will be no more danger, for all will have the means of living. Besides, if anyone wanted to steal your cloak, you would give it to him yourself. Why not? You will only have to go to the common store and be given a better one.		
A3946	The women have decreed that if a young man desires a young girl, he can only lay her after having satisfied an old woman; and if he refuses and goes to seek the maiden, the old women are authorized to seize him and drag him in.”		
A3949	Happy are ye, who form choruses before our house!  Happy are ye, both neighbors and fellow-citizens! Happy am I myself! I am but a servant, and yet I have poured on my hair the most exquisite essences.  Let thanks be rendered to thee, Oh, Zeus!		
A3950	Generously invite everyone and omit no one, old or young.  Dinner is ready for all; they need only go home.		
A3951	If the lot has assigned my comedy to be played first of all, don't let that be a disadvantage to me; engrave in your memory all that shall have pleased you in it and judge the competitors equitably as you have bound yourselves by oath to do.		
A3960	It is right and just for our sacred chorus  to advise and teach what's good for the city.  So first it seems best to us to equalize the citizens and take away their fears		
A3961	And if anyone went astray, tripped by the wrestling moves  of Phrynichus, I say it should be possible for those who slipped up then to plead their cause and erase their previous mistakes.		
A3962	But letting up on your anger, you who are wisest in nature, let's gladly make everyone our kinsman and full-fledged citizens too, who's ever fought for us at  sea.		
A3966	“Persuasion has no other shrine save speech.”		
A3967	They are my friends, and I won't judge them. For I will not be on hostile terms with either one. One I consider clever, the other I enjoy.		
A3968	I came down here for a poet. For what purpose? So that the city might be saved to stage its choruses. So whichever of you will give the state some useful advice, that's the one I think I'll take.		
A3972	If we distrusted those citizens in whom We now place confidence, and employed those we don't use now, we would be saved. If we now are suffering under the present circumstances, why wouldn't we be saved by doing the opposite?		
A3973	When they consider the land of the enemy to be their own, and their own the enemy's, their ships a revenue, and their revenue a loss.		
A3974	My tongue did swear, but Aeschylus I choose.		
A3975	Dionysus By Zeus the Savior, I can't decide. For one has spoken cleverly, and the other one clearly. Now each of you once more tell me your opinion about the state, what plan you have to save her.		
A3976	For this man of proven good sense will go back home again for the good of his citizens, for the good of his own relatives and friends, on account of being intelligent.		
A3977	Well then, farewell, Aeschylus, go and save our city with noble sentiments, and educate the dunces.		
A3988	Great the event, abundant the strife, grand the war that advances. So it's hard work to choose when one strains violently, while the other can twist around and bear down sharply.		
A3990	So fear not, but scrutinize every topic, for the audience's sake at least, since they're so sophisticated.		
A3991	Now is this not outrage and utter insolence, That I myself, Dionysos, son of Winejug, must walk, and let this fellow ride, so he might feel no pain and bear no burden?		
A4010	Not him, by Zeus, but he kissed Aeschylus When he arrived, and shook his hand, And yielded the chair to him.		
A4016	Come now, someone bring incense and fire, So I can pray before the show of wits to judge this contest most aesthetically.		
A4019	For this was a democratic thing I did.		
A4026	But if you're both afraid that our spectators lack a certain amount of knowledge, so as not to appreciate the fine points of what you say, don't worry about that, since that is no longer the case. For they are seasoned veterans and each one has a book and understands the clever stuff.		
A4031	Blessed is the man having perfected intelligence.		
A4034	First grant bon voyage to the departing poet as he rises to the light, ye spirits under the earth, and grant to the city good ideas for great gains. For we would then cease completely from these great woes and dire clashes in arms.		
A4041	But if the women join us From Peloponnesus and Boeotia, then Hand in hand we'll rescue Greece.		
A4042	Still, thought is free.... But if the women join us From Peloponnesus and Boeotia, then Hand in hand we'll rescue Greece.		
A4043	No man will lift a lance against another—		
A4047	O women, if we would compel the men To bow to Peace,		
A4050	Peace maun be thought of first.		
A4051	Love's lack except wi' makeshifts.... But let it be. Peace maun be thought of first.		
A4055	For us I ha' no doubt. We can persuade Our men to strike a fair an' decent Peace,		
A4056	We shall surprise the Acropolis today: That is the duty set the older dames.		
A4057	Set out the terms in detail And we'll a' swear to them.		
A4058	You, Calonice, repeat for the rest Each word I say. Then you must all take oath And pledge your arms to the same stern conditions—		
A4061	Shall light a fear in us; we will come out To Peace alone.		
A4069	I'm a free woman, I.		
A4071	I'm coming of my own accord.... Why bars? It is not bars we need but common sense.		
A4075	To take first the treasury out of your management, and so stop the war through the absence of gold.		
A4077	But we abolish war straight by our policy.		
A4082	Earth I could brave with laughter, Having such wonderful girls here to friend. O the daring, the gracious, the beautiful ones! Their courage unswerving and witty Will rescue our city.		
A4084	Prepare for the battle, all. Gird up your angers. Our way the wind of sweet victory settles.		
A4085	I think that perhaps then they'll give us our title— Peace-makers.		
A4098	An oracle has promised Victory If we don't wrangle. Would you hear the words?		
A4103	Then return to Sparta. Bid them Send envoys with full powers to treat of Peace; And I will urge the Senate here to choose Plenipotentiary ambassadors, As argument adducing this connection.		
A4108	But come, these enmities let's quell. You stop from giving orders and I'll stop from doing wrong.		
A4109	There's only one condition made (Indulge my whim in this I pray)— When Peace is signed once more, On no account am I to be repaid.		
A4110	But on the contrary to promote good feeling in the state By word and deed. We've had enough calamities of late. So let a man or woman but divulge		
A4111	Unless Peace is soon declared, we shall be driven In the void of women to try Cleisthenes.		
A4116	I've never seen a nobler woman anywhere.		
A4117	Now, brethren twined with mutual benefactions, Can you still war, can you suffer such disgrace? Why not be friends? What is there to prevent you?		
A4118	There's no distinction in our politics: We've risen as one man to this conclusion;		
A4119	Earth is delighted now, peace is the voice of earth.		
A4120	Spartans, sort out your wives: Athenians, yours. Let each catch hands with his wife and dance his joy,		
A4121	And all the Daimons summon hither to be Witnesses of our revelry And of the noble Peace we have made, Aphrodite our aid.		
A4125	O Goddess, suffer not, I pray, this harsh deed to be done, But show us Greece and Athens with their warlike acts repealed!		
A4128	All who inside Athens' walls have their dwelling into one great common basket we'll pack. Disenfranchised or citizens, allies or aliens, pell-mell the lot of them in we will squeeze. Till they discover humanity's meaning...		
A4129	Each portion we'll take and wind in to this centre, inward to Athens each loyalty pull, Till from the vast heap where all's piled together at last can be woven a strong Cloak of State.		
A4131	We come to treat o' Peace. ATHENIANS Well spoken there! And we the same. Let us callout Lysistrata Since she alone can settle the Peace-terms.		
A4132	ATHENIANS I want to strip at once and plough my land. SPARTANS And mine I want to fertilize at once. LYSISTRATA And so you can, when Peace is once declared.		
A4133	I agree with all of you. Now off, and cleanse yourselves for the Acropolis, For we invite you all in to a supper From our commissariat baskets.		
A4135	When we are warm with wine, how wise we grow.		
A4137	Come, Hunting Girl, an' hear my prayer— You whose arrows whizz in woodlands, come an' bless This Peace we swear.		
A4138	Dance out his thanks, be grateful in music, And promise reformation with his heels.		
A4139	That's only fair, since sober we're such fools:		
A4140	Lead thou the dance, gather thy joyous tresses up i' bands An' play like a fawn. To madden them, clap thy hands, And sing praise to the warrior goddess templed i' our lands, Her o' the House o' Brass.		
A4141	Let us be fenced wi' age long amity, O let this bond stick ever firm through thee In friendly happiness.		
A4143	The women have appropriated the citadel. So, Lampito, dash off to your own land And raise the rebels there.		
A4151	Now will you help me, if I find a means To stamp the war out.		
A4152	And half is hackt off as the price of peace.		
A4153	And I too! Why, to get a peep at the shy thing I'd clamber up to the tip-top o' Taygetus.		
A4158	But, hardy Spartan, if you join with me All may be righted yet. O help me, help me.		
A4159	But let it be. Peace maun be thought of first.		
A4160	My friend, my friend! The only one amid this herd of weaklings.		
A4164	SO, grasp the brim, you, Lampito, and all. You, Calonice, repeat for the rest Each word I say. Then you must all take oath And pledge your arms to the same stern conditions—		
A4165	Do you all swear to this? MYRRHINE We do, we do. LYSISTRATA Then I shall immolate the victim thus. She drinks.		
A4166	As I told you, The women have appropriated the citadel.		
A4173	On, gallant allies of our high design, Vendors of grain-eggs-pulse-and-vegetables, Ye garlic-tavern-keepers of bakeries, Strike, batter, knock, hit, slap, and scratch our foes, Be finely imprudent, say what you think of them....		
A4175	Still if you wake a wasps' nest then of wasps you must beware.		
A4176	If you should do the same again, I'll punch you in the eye.		
A4184	In our comradely venture Each taking her due part.		
A4185	soon you will find that the War has an end.		
A4186	So to untangle the War and its errors, ambassadors out on all sides we will send This way and that, here, there and round about		
A4188	Through the whole city for all greasy fellows; burrs too, the parasites, off we will rub. That verminous plague of insensate place-seekers soon between thumb and forefinger we'll crack.		
A4193	Every silly old-man threat While Lampito's with me. Or dear Ismenia, the noble Theban girl.		
A4198	Not till a treaty finishes the war.		
A4199	With sympathy your case I view;		
A4204	There's only one condition made (Indulge my whim in this I pray)— When Peace is signed once more		
A4209	I want to strip at once and plough my land. SPARTANS And mine I want to fertilize at once. LYSISTRATA And so you can, when Peace is once declared		
A4211	Let each catch hands with his wife and dance his joy, Dance out his thanks, be grateful in music		
A4212	Spartans, sort out your wives: Athenians, yours.		
A4213	And promise reformation with his heels.		
A4217	the price of peace.		
A4222	Well if you must have it so, we'll all agree.		
A4223	Do you all swear to this?		
A4224	We do, we do.		
A4225	Greece and Athens with their warlike acts repealed!		
A4227	It is not bars we need but common sense.		
A4229	f you should do the same again, I'll punch you in the eye.		
A4238	Bid them Send envoys with full powers to treat of Peace;		
A4240	We come to treat o' Peace.		
A4241	Well spoken there! And we the same. Let us callout Lysistrata Since she alone can settle the Peace-terms.		
A4243	And so you can, when Peace is once declared.		
A4244	And of the noble Peace we have made,		
A4245	Happy Hera, Queen of all, And all the Daimons summon hither to be Witnesses of our revelry And of the noble Peace we have made, Aphrodite our aid.		
A4246	Oh! Zeus, what art thou going to do for our people? Dost thou not see this, that our cities will soon be but empty husks?		
A4247	I want to ask him what he reckons to do for all the Greeks. First Servant And if he doesn't tell you? Trygaeus I shall pursue him at law as a traitor who sells Greece to the Medes.		
A4248	You hurt me too sorely, my daughters, when you ask me for bread, calling me your daddy, and there is not the ghost of an obolus in the house; if I succeed and come back, you will have a barley loaf every morning —and a punch in the eye for sauce!		
A4253	Oh, what misery the very sight of War causes me! This then is the foe from whom I fly, who is so cruel, so formidable, so stalwart, so solid on his legs!		
A4254	See the danger that threatens if he returns with the pestle, for War will quietly amuse himself with pounding all the towns of Hellas to pieces.		
A4255	Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when freed of quarrels and fighting, we should rescue sweet Peace and draw her out of this pit, before some other pestle prevents us		
A4256	Come, laborers, merchants, workmen, artisans, strangers,  whether you be domiciled or not, islanders— Come here, Greeks of all countries, come hurrying here with picks and levers and ropes!This is the moment to drain a cup in honor of the Good Genius.		
A4258	All peoples of Greece, now is the time or never, for you to help each other. You see yourselves freed from battles and all their horrors of bloodshed.		
A4260	Once we have hold of her, none in the world will be able to take her from us.		
A4261	I am so happy, so delighted at not having to carry my buckler any more. I fart for joy and I laugh more than if I had cast my old age, as a serpent does its skin.		
A4262	But when you have got the goddess, Then rejoice, shout and laugh; thenceforward you will be able to sail or stay at home, to make love or sleep, to attend festivals and processions, to play at cottabos, live like true Sybarites and to shout, Io, io!		
A4263	Ah! God grant we may see the blessed day. I have suffered so much; have so oft slept with Phormio on hard beds. You will no longer find me a bitter and angry judge, nor, naturally, hard in my ways, as heretofore, but turned indulgent and grown younger by twenty years through happiness. We have been killing ourselves long enough, tiring ourselves out with going to the Lyceum and returning laden with spear and buckler.		
A4264	Be not pitiless toward our prayers; permit us to deliver the goddess. Oh! the most human, the most generous of the gods, be favourable toward us, if it be true that you detest the haughty crests and proud brows of Pisander; we shall never cease, oh master, offering you sacred victims and solemn prayers.		
A4265	Because it is to you that we sacrifice, whereas the barbarians worship them; hence they would like to see you destroyed, that they alone might receive the offerings.		
A4266	So therefore, Hermes, my friend, help us with your whole heart to find and deliver the captive and we will celebrate the great Panathenaea in your honor as well as all the festivals of the other gods; for Hermes shall be the Mysteries, the Dipolia, the Adonia; everywhere the towns, freed from their miseries, will sacrifice to Hermes the Liberator;		
A4267	Come, come, there is no working together. Come! all pull at the same instant!		
A4268	Come! all together! Everyone to the work and with a good heart for the business.		
A4270	Come then, all together! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! All together!		
A4271	Chorus Come then, all together! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! All together! Peace is drawn out of the pit. With her come Opora and Theoria.		
A4272	Ah! venerated goddess, who givest us our grapes, where am I to find the ten-thousand-gallon words wherewith to greet thee? I have none such at home. Oh! hail to thee, Opora, and thee, Theoria! How beautiful is thy face! How sweet thy breath! What gentle fragrance comes from thy bosom, gentle as freedom from military duty, as the most dainty perfumes!		
A4273	Let the husbandmen take their farming tools and return to their fields as quickly as possible, but without either sword, spear or javelin. All is as quiet as if Peace had been reigning for a century.		
A4274	Oh, thou, whom men of standing desired and who art good to husbandmen, I have gazed upon thee with delight; and now I go to greet my vines, to caress after so long an absence the fig trees I planted in my youth.		
A4275	Friends, do you remember the happy life that Peace afforded us formerly; can you recall the splendid baskets of figs, both fresh and dried, the myrtles, the sweet wine, the violets blooming near the spring, and the olives, for which we have wept so much? Worship, adore the goddess for restoring you so many blessings.		
A4278	Come, who wishes to take the charge of her? No one? Come, Theoria, I am going to lead you into the midst of the spectators and confide you to their care.		
A4280	How everything succeeds to our wish, when the gods are willing and Fortune favours us! how opportunely everything falls out.		
A4281	Oh! Peace, mighty queen, venerated goddess, thou, who presidest over choruses and at nuptials, deign to accept the sacrifices we offer thee.		
A4282	Put an end to this tittle-tattle, to this idle babble, that set us defying one another. Cause the Greeks once more to taste the pleasant beverage of friendship and temper all hearts with the gentle feeling of forgiveness.		
A4283	Oh! joy, joy! no more helmet, no more cheese nor onions!No, I have no passion for battles; what I love is to drink with good comrades in the corner by the fire when good dry wood, cut in the height of the summer, is crackling; it is to cook pease on the coals and beechnuts among the embers, it is to kiss our pretty Thracian while my wife is at the bath.		
A4286	As for me, I will explain the matter to you all, children, youths, grown-ups and old men, aye, even to the decrepit dotards.		
A4288	“Ah! Zeus,” he cries, “what are thy intentions? Lay aside thy besom; do not sweep Greece away!” Ah! Hush, hush! I think I hear his voice!		
A4295	If there be a citizen, greedy for military rank and honors, who refuses, oh, divine Peace! to restore you to daylight— Chorus May he behave as cowardly as Cleonymus on the battlefield.		
A4299	Hail! hail! thou beloved divinity! thy return overwhelms us with joy. When far from thee, my ardent wish to see my fields again made me pine with regret. From thee came all blessings. Oh! much desired Peace! thou art the sole support of those who spend their lives tilling the earth.		
A4300	She says, that after the affair of Pylos she came to you unbidden to bring you a basket full of truces and that you thrice repulsed her by your votes in the assembly. Trygaeus Yes, we did wrong, but forgive us, for our mind was then entirely absorbed in leather.		
A4301	Undoubtedly the comic poet who mounted the stage to praise himself in the parabasis would deserve to be handed over to the sticks of the beadles. Nevertheless, oh Muse, if it be right to esteem the most honest and illustrious of our comic writers at his proper value, permit our poet to say that he thinks he has deserved a glorious renown.		
A4313	Don't talk, for it is divine Peace to whom we are sacrificing.		
A4316	Trygaeus Then what should be done? Not to stop War would be to leave it to the decision of chance which of the two people should suffer the most, whereas by uniting under a treaty, we share the empire of Greece.		
A4317	Wise Homer has also said: “He who delights in the horrors of civil war has neither country nor laws nor home.” What noble words!		
A4318	And all of you, who yesterday were dying of hunger, come, stuff yourselves with this fine hare-stew; it's not every day that we find cakes lying neglected.Eat, eat, or I predict you will soon regret it.		
A4319	But come, comrades, we who are in the first row, let us pick up the bridegroom and carry him in triumph.		
A4320	Chorus Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus! Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!  Trygaeus Hail, hail, my friends. All who come with me shall have cakes galore.		
A4321	Oh! thrice happy man, who so well deserve your good fortune!		
A4322	You, who remain to the feast, it's your duty to devour dish after dish and not to ply empty jaws. Come, put heart into the work and eat with your mouths full. For, believe me, poor friends, white teeth are useless furniture if they chew nothing.		
A4326	But the god, Apollo,in tragic style  whose oracles the Pythian priestess on her golden tripod makes known to us, deserves my censure, for surely he is a physician and a cunning diviner;		
A4346	moderation is the strong point in my character. I love saving as much as anybody, and I know how to spend, when it's needed.		
A4348	My master is going to drag you all out of the stupid, sapless life you are leading and ensure you one full of all delights.		
A4349	Friends, it's Plutus whom my master brings, Plutus, who will give you riches.		
A4352	But I have thought the matter well over, and the best thing is to make Plutus lie in the Temple of Asclepius. Blepsidemus Unquestionably that's the very best thing. Hurry and lead him away to the temple.		
A4354	My arm shall destroy you, you infamous beings! Such an attempt is not to be borne; neither man nor god has ever dared the like. You shall die!		
A4355	Poverty I am one that will punish you this very day for having wanted to make me disappear from here.		
A4359	It is right that the good should be happy, that the wicked and the impious, on the other hand, should be miserable; that is a truth, I believe, which no one will gainsay. To realize this condition of things is a proposal as great as it is noble and useful in every respect, and we have found a means of attaining the object of our wishes. If Plutus recovers his sight and ceases from wandering about unseeing and at random, he will go to seek the just men and never leave them again; he will shun the perverse and ungodly; so, thanks to him, all men will become honest, rich and pious. Can anything better be conceived for the public weal?		
A4360	It is right that the good should be happy, that the wicked and the impious, on the other hand, should be miserable; that is a truth, I believe, which no one will gainsay		
A4361	If Plutus recovers his sight and ceases from wandering about unseeing and at random, he will go to seek the just men and never leave them again; he will shun the perverse and ungodly; so, thanks to him, all men will become honest, rich and pious		
A4364	Let Plutus recover his sight and divide his favours out equally to all, and none will ply either trade or art any longer; all toil would be done away with.		
A4367	The poor man lives thriftily and attentive to his work; he has not got too much, but he does not lack what he really needs.		
A4373	What joy for my master and even more for Plutus! The god has regained his sight; his eyes sparkle with the greatest brilliancy, thanks to the benevolent care of Asclepius.		
A4374	I will sing to the honor of Asclepius, the son of illustrious Zeus, with a resounding voice; he is the beneficent star which men adore.		
A4375	Neoclides shrieked, howled, sprang towards the foot of his bed and wanted to bolt, but the god laughed and said to him, “Keep where you are with your salve; by doing this you will not go and perjure yourself before the Assembly.”		
A4376	As for myself, I did not cease thanking the god who had so quickly restored to Plutus his sight and had made Neoclides blinder than ever.		
A4377	The rich, whose wealth is ill-gotten, are knitting their brows and shooting at him looks of fierce hate, while the just folk, who led a wretched existence, embrace him and grasp his hand in the transport of their joy;		
A4378	Come, all of you, all, down to the very least, dance, leap and form yourselves into a chorus; no longer do you risk being told, when you go home. “There is no meal in the bag.”		
A4381	How pleasant it is, friends, to live well, especially when it costs nothing!  What a deluge of blessings flood our household, and that too without our having wronged a single soul!  [Ah! what a delightful thing is wealth!		
A4382	My father had left me a fairly decent fortune, and I helped those of my friends who were in want; it was, to my thinking, the most useful thing I could do with my fortune.		
A4391	Plutus Zeus inflicted it on me, because of his jealousy of mankind. When I was young, I threatened him that I would only go to the just, the wise, the men of ordered life; to prevent my distinguishing these, he struck me with blindness! so much does he envy the good!		
A4393	My master is going to drag you all out of the stupid, sapless life you are leading and ensure you one full of all delights. Leader of the Chorus		
A4394	I will no longer conceal the truth from you. Friends, it's Plutus whom my master brings, Plutus, who will give you riches.		
A4395	Seek physicians at Athens? Nay! there's no art where there's no fee.		
A4397	Agathon's Chorus I do honor to the divine Leto and to the lyre, the mother of songsof male and noble strains. The eyes of the goddess sparkle while listening to our enthusiastic chants. Honor to the powerful Phoebus! Hail! blessed son of Leto.		
A4398	My dress is in harmony with my thoughts. A poet must adopt the nature of his characters. Thus, if he is placing women on the stage, he must contract all their habits in his own person.		
A4399	If the heroes are men, everything in him will be manly. What we don't possess by nature, we must acquire by imitation.		
A4400	For this reason his pieces were also beautiful, for the works of a poet are copied from himself.		
A4401	The women purpose killing me to-day during the Thesmophoria, because I have dared to speak ill of them.		
A4404	Mnesilochus Remember, it's the heart, and not the tongue, that has sworn; for the oaths of the tongue concern me but little.		
A4408	if there be a man who is plotting against the womenfolk or who, to injure them, is proposing peace to Euripides and the Medes, or who aspires to usurping the tyranny, plots the return of a tyrant, or unmasks a supposititious child; or if there be a slave who, a confidential party to a wife's intrigues, reveals them secretly to her husband, or who, entrusted with a message, does not deliver the same faithfully; if there be a lover who fulfils naught of what he has promised a woman, whom he has abused on the strength of his lies; if there be an old woman who seduces the lover of a maiden by dint of her presents and treacherously receives him in her house; if there be a host or hostess who sells false measure, pray the gods that they will overwhelm them with their wrath,both them and their families, and that they may reserve all their favours for you.		
A4409	Let us ask the fulfillment of these wishes both for the city and for the people, and may the wisest of us cause her opinion to be accepted.		
A4416	He will knowhow we punish the outrage, the crime, the sacrilege. The criminal will then acknowledge at last that gods exist;		
A4417	his fate will teach all men that the deities must be revered, that justice must be observed and that they must submit to the sacred laws. If not, then woe to them! Heaven itself will punish sacrilege; being aflame with fury and mad with frenzy, all their deeds will prove to mortals, both men and women, that the deity punishes injustice and impiety, and that she is not slow to strike.		
A4422	There are many reproaches we have the right to bring against men. The most serious is this, that the woman, who has given birth to a useful citizen, whether taxiarch or strategus should receive some distinction; a place of honor should be reserved for her at the Stenia, the Scirophoria,and the other festivals that we keep.		
A4423	On the other hand, she of whom a coward was born or a worthless man, a bad trierarch or an unskilful pilot, should sit with shaven head, behind her sister who had borne a brave man.		
A4425	Women, if you will be reconciled with me, I am willing, and I undertake never to say anything ill of you in future. Those are my proposals for peace.		
A4426	This unfortunate man, who is chained to the post, is my father-in-law; if you will restore him to me, you will have no more cause to complain of me; but if not, I shall reveal your pranks to your husbands when they return from the war.		
A4427	What need for you to hear what you are going to see?		
A4428	is going to construct the framework of a drama. He is rounding fresh poetical forms, he is polishing them in the lathe and is welding them; he is hammering out sentences and metaphors; he is working up his subject like soft wax. First he models it and then he casts it in bronze—		
A4432	Let us form fresh measures that keep good time, and may our songs resound to the very heavens.  Do thou, oh divine Bacchus, who art crowned with ivy, direct our chorus; 'tis to thee that both my hymns and my dances are dedicated.		
A4440	No more shall I your daughter share your bondage		
A4441	For your unhappiness I weep with plaintive wail, mother		
A4442	Even in adversity it is wise to yield to reason's dictates		
A4445	Are not you then playing a sorry part to plot against me thus, after the kind treatment you by your own confession received from me, showing me no gratitude but all the ill you can? A thankless race! all you who covet honor from the mob  for your oratory. Oh that you were unknown to me! you who harm your friends and think no more of it, if you can say a word to win the mob. But tell me, what kind of cleverness did they think it, when against this child they passed their bloody vote?  Was it duty that led them to slay a human victim at the tomb, where sacrifice of oxen is more fitting? or does Achilles, if claiming the lives of those who slew him as his recompense, show his justice by marking her out for death? No! she at least never injured him.  He should have demanded Helen as a victim at his tomb, for she it was that proved his ruin, bringing him to Troy; or if some captive of surpassing beauty was to be singled out for death, this did not point to us; for the daughter of Tyndareus was fairest of all,  and her injury to him was proved no less than ours. Against the justice of his plea I pit this argument.		
A4449	Human nature is not so stony-hearted as to hear your plaintive tale and catalogue of sorrows, without shedding a tear.		
A4465	O dreadful crime! O deed without a name! beyond wonder!  impious! intolerable! Where are the laws between guest and host? Accursed of men! how have you mangled his flesh, slashing the poor child's limbs  with ruthless sword, lost to all sense of pity!		
A4467	but, if otherwise, help me to punish  this most godless host, fearless alike of gods in heaven or hell, who has done a most unholy deed; who, though often he had shared my board and been counted first of all my guest-friends  meeting with every kindness he could claim—. And receiving my consideration, he slew my son, and bent though he was on murder, did not think it right to bury him, but cast his body forth to sea.		
A4469	Now if this principle, when referred to you, is to be set at nothing, and they are to escape punishment who murder guests or dare to plunder the temples of gods,  then all fairness in human matters is at an end.		
A4470	Why, oh! why do we mortals toil, as we must, and seek out all other sciences,  but Persuasion, the only real mistress of mankind, we take no further pains to master completely by offering to pay for the knowledge, so that any man could convince his fellows as he pleased and gain his point at once?		
A4471	For it is always a good man's duty to help the right,  and to punish evil-doers wherever found.		
A4474	this is the interest alike of citizen and state, that the wrong-doer be punished and the good man prosper		
A4476	For the rights of justice and of the gods do not fall together;  there is ruin full of death and doom.		
A4477	Woe to you! what grievous outrage has been done to you! a fearful penalty for your foul deed.		
A4478	banish that savage spirit from your heart  and plead your cause, so that after hearing you and her in turn I may fairly decide what reason there is for your present sufferings.		
A4480	Never ought words to have outweighed deeds in this world, Agamemnon. No! if a man's deeds were good, so should his words have been;  if, on the other hand, evil, his words should have been unsound, instead of its being possible at times to speak injustice well. There are, it is true, clever persons, who have made a science of this, but their cleverness cannot last for ever; a miserable end awaits them; no one ever yet escaped.		
A4481	Ah! how a good cause always affords men an opening for a good speech.		
A4487	For she has a terrible temper and will not put up with bad treatment		
A4488	to trusty servants it is a disaster when the dice of their masters' fortunes  fall badly: it touches their hearts. So great is the grief I feel that the desire stole over me to come out here and speak my mistress' troubles to the earth and the sky.		
A4492	For it is better to be accustomed to live on terms of equality. At any rate, may I be able to grow old in modest state and with security.		
A4493	it is no joy I feel at this house's misfortunes since I have shared the cup of friendship with it.		
A4494	Zeus will be your advocate in this.		
A4497	There is no justice in mortals' eyes  since before they get sure knowledge of a man's true character they hate him on sight, although he has done them no harm.		
A4517	First, you now live among Greeks and not barbarians, and you understand justice and the rule of law, with no concession to force.		
A4522	If you come to my country, I shall in justice try to act as your protector.		
A4527	Tell him nothing of my intentions, if you are loyal to your mistress and a woman.		
A4538	O detestable creature, utterly hateful to the gods, to me, and to the whole human race,  you brought yourself to take the sword to your own children and destroyed my life with childlessness! And having done this can you look on the sun and the earth, when you are guilty of a most abominable deed? Death and ruin seize you! Now I am in my right mind, though I was insane before  when I brought you from your home among the barbarians to a Greek house. A great curse you were even then, betrayer of father and of the land that nourished you. But the avenging spirit meant for you the gods have visited on me. For you killed your own brother at the hearth  and then stepped aboard the fair-prowed Argo. It was with acts like these that you began. But now when you were married to me and had borne me children, you killed them because of sex and the marriage-bed. No Greek woman  would have dared to do this, yet I married you in preference to them, and a hateful and destructive match it has proved. You are a she-lion, not a woman, with a nature more savage than Scylla the Tuscan monster. But since ten thousand insults of mine would fail  to sting you—such is your native impudence—be gone, doer of disgraceful deeds and murderer of your children! Mine is a fate to bewail: I shall never have the benefit of my new bride, nor will I be able to speak to my children alive,  the children I begot and raised, but have lost them.		
A4540	For a woman of sense, yes. But you find everything a disaster.		
A4542	May the Fury that punishes your children's death, and  Justice the murderous,23 destroy you utterly!		
A4548	This prayer I make, when I behold these aged women, who, leaving their homes in Argos,  now throw themselves with suppliant branches at my knees in their terrible trouble		
A4564	He has my praise, whichever god brought us to live by rule from chaos and from brutishness, first by implanting reason, and next by giving us a tongue to declare our thoughts, so as to know the meaning of what is said,		
A4570	For there are three ranks of citizens; the rich, a useless set, that ever crave for more;  the poor and destitute, fearful folk, that cherish envy more than is right, and shoot out grievous stings against the men who have anything, beguiled as they are by the eloquence of vicious leaders; while the class that is midmost of the three preserves cities,  observing such order as the state ordains.		
A4571	I did not choose you to judge my affliction; no! nor if in anything my fortunes prove me wrong,  did I come to you to punish or correct them, but to seek your help.		
A4579	for this it is that holds men's states together—strict observance of the laws.		
A4584	But I require the whole city's sanction also,  which my wish will ensure; still, by communicating the proposal to them I would find the people better disposed. For I made them supreme, when I set this city free, by giving all an equal vote.		
A4586	for a wretched son is he who does not serve his parents in return—fairest contribution; for, when he made his gift, he in his turn from his own sons receives all such service as he gave to his parents.		
A4587	For pious toil is a fair ornament to cities, and carries with it a grace that never wastes away.		
A4588	O help the mother, city of Pallas, that so they may not pollute the laws of all mankind. You, I know,  reverence right, and to injustice deal out  defeat, a protection at all times to the afflicted.		
A4589	You have made a false beginning to your speech, stranger, in seeking a despot here. For this city is not ruled  by one man, but is free.		
A4590	The people rule in succession year by year, allowing no preference to wealth, but the poor man shares equally with the rich.		
A4593	Nothing is more hostile to a city than a despot;		
A4596	Freedom's mark is also seen in this: “Who has wholesome counsel to declare unto the state?”  And he who chooses to do so gains renown, while he, who has no wish, remains silent. What greater equality can there be in a city?		
A4600	And yet each man among us knows which of the two to prefer, the good or ill, and how much better peace is for mankind than war, peace, the Muses' dearest friend,  the foe of Sorrow, whose joy is in glad throngs of children, and its delight in prosperity. These are the blessings we cast away and wickedly embark on war, man enslaving his weaker brother, and cities following suit.		
A4601	The wise should love their children first, next their parents and country, whose fortunes they ought to increase rather than break down		
A4610	for noble nurture carries reverence with it, and every man, when once he has practised virtue, scorns the name of villain.		
A4611	Courage may be learned, for even a baby learns  to speak and hear things it cannot comprehend; and whatever someone has learned, this it is his wont to treasure up till he is old. So train up your children in a virtuous way.		
A4613	O wretched sons of men!  Why do you get weapons and bring slaughter on one another? Cease from that, give over your toiling, and in mutual peace keep safe your cities.		
A4614	Short is the span of life, so it would be best to run its course as lightly as we may, free from trouble.		
A4621	There is nothing—no pain, no ruin,no shame, nor dishonor—that I have not seen in your sufferings and mine.		
A4625	my sister		
A4626	he is my brother, and yours too		
A4627	I will never be convicted of betraying him.		
A4631	I will bury him		
A4632	—it would honor me to die while doing that		
A4633	they say that an edict has been published to the townsmen		
A4634	Will you join your hand to mine in order to lift his corpse		
A4635	Consider whether you will share the toil and the task.		
A4637	And when he saw them advancing in a swollen flood,arrogant their clanging gold, he dashed with brandished fire one who was already starting to shout victory when he had reached our ramparts. Chorus Staggered, he fell to the earth with a crash,torch in hand, a man possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate.  But his threats did not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed each their own dooms with hard blows,Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point.		
A4638	But since Victory whose name is glory has come to us, smiling in joy equal to the joy of chariot-rich Thebes,let us make for ourselves forgetfulness after the recent wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long dance and song.  And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of Thebes, rule our dancing!		
A4639	I knew, first of all, how constant was your reverence for the power of the throne of Laius;  how, again, you were reverent, when Oedipus was guiding our city;  and lastly, how, when he was dead, you still maintained loyal thoughts towards his children.		
A4641	Eteocles, who fell fightingin behalf of our city and who excelled all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that descends to the noblest of the dead below.		
A4643	That is your will, Creon, towards this city's enemy and its friend.  And the power is yours, I believe, to make use of every law whatsoever, both concerning the dead and all us who live.		
A4645	If you do not find the very hand that made this burial, and reveal him before my eyes, mere death shall not suffice for you, not before, hung up alive, you have made this outrage plain,		
A4647	This power spans the sea, even when it surges white before the gales of the south-wind, and makes a path under swells that threaten to engulf him.  Earth, too, the eldest of the gods, the immortal, the unwearied,he wears away to his own ends, turning the soil with the offspring of horses as the plows weave to and fro year after year.		
A4648	The light-hearted tribe of birdsand the clans of wild beasts and the sea-brood of the deep he snares in the meshes of his twisted nets, and he leads them captive, very-skilled man.  He masters by his artsthe beast who dwells in the wilds and roams the hills.  He tames the shaggy-maned horse, putting the yoke upon its neck, and tames the tireless mountain bull.		
A4649	Speech and thought fast as thewind and the moods that give order to a city he has taught himself, and how to flee the arrows of the inhospitable frost under clear skies and the arrows of the storming rain.He has resource for everything.  Lacking resource in nothing he strides towards what must come		
A4650	from baffling diseases he has devised flights.		
A4652	So she, too, when she saw the corpse bare, broke into a cry of lamentation and cursed with harsh curses those who had done it.  Immediately she took thirsty dust in her hands,and from a pitcher of beaten bronze held high she crowned the dead with thrice-poured libations.		
A4655	I knew it.  How could I not?		
A4662	Look, here comes Ismene from the palace, shedding the tears of a loving sister.  A cloud over her eyes mars her red-flushed face,and it breaks into rain on her comely cheek.		
A4671	But now, witnessing this, I too am carried beyond the bounds of loyalty.  The power fails me to keep back my streaming tears any longer, when I see Antigone making her way to the chamber where all are laid to rest,now her bridal chamber.		
A4675	Take her away—now!  And when you have enshrouded her, as I proclaimed, in her covered tomb, leave her alone, deserted—let her decide whether she wishes to die or to live entombed in such a home		
A4676	But now, Polyneices, it is for tending your corpse that I win such reward as this. [And yet I honored you rightly, as the wise understand.Never, if I had been a mother of children, or if a husband had been rotting after death, would I have taken that burden upon myself in violation of the citizens' will.  For the sake of what law, you ask, do I say that?  A husband lost, another might have been found,and if bereft of a child, there could be a second from some other man.  But when father and mother are hidden in  Hades, no brother could ever bloom for me again.  Such was the law whereby I held you first in honor, but for that Creon judged me guilty of wrongdoingand of dreadful outrage, dear brother!		
A4680	And Dryas's son, the Edonian king swift to rage, was tamed in recompense for his frenzied insults, when, by the will of Dionysus, he was shut in a rocky prison.  There the fierce and swelling force of his madness trickled away.		
A4681	Teiresias —by how much the most precious of our possessions is the power to reason wisely? Creon By as much, I think, as senselessness is the greatest affliction.		
A4682	For these crimes the avenging destroyers,the Furies of Hades and of the gods, lie in ambush for you, waiting to seize you in these same sufferings.		
A4686	Wisdom is provided as the chief part of happiness		
A4688	in old age teach wisdom.		
A4690	My king, my thoughts have long been deliberating whether this deed is somehow the work of gods?		
A4691	Saved just now beyond hope and belief, I owe the gods great thanks		
A4696	Possessing resourceful skill, a subtlety beyond expectation		
A4698	They say that he does not conduct this business lightly,but whoever performs any of these rites, for him the fate appointed is death by public stoning among the entire city.		
A4703	Think, sister, how our fatherperished in hatred and infamy, when, because of the crimes that he himself detected, he smashed both his eyes with self-blinding hand;  then his mother-wife, two names in one, with a twisted noose destroyed her life;lastly, our two brothers in a single day, both unhappy murderers of their own flesh and blood, worked with mutual hands their common doom.		
A4712	Go, then, if you so decide.  And of this be sure:  though your path is foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and true.		
A4718	And if any man thinks a friend more important than his fatherland, that man, I say, is of no account.		
A4720	t has been proclaimed to the city that no one shall give him funeral honors or lamentation,but all must leave him unburied and a sight of shame, with his body there for birds and dogs to eat.		
A4727	But all the men who did this job for hire have made sure that, sooner or later, they shall suffer the punishment.		
A4729	Speech and thought fast as thewind and the moods that give order to a city he has taught himself, and how to flee the arrows of the inhospitable frost under clear skies and the arrows of the storming rain.He has resource for everything.		
A4730	Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man.This power spans the sea, even when it surges white before the gales of the south-wind, and makes a path under swells that threaten to engulf him.  Earth, too, the eldest of the gods, the immortal, the unwearied,he wears away to his own ends, turning the soil with the offspring of horses as the plows weave to and fro year after year.		
A4749	Antigone Save yourself.  I do not grudge your escape. Ismene Ah, misery!  Will I fall short of sharing your fate? Antigone Your choice was to live, it was mine to die. Ismene At least your choice was not made without my protests. Antigone One world approved your wisdom, another approved mine. Ismene Nevertheless, the offense is identical for both of us. Antigone Take heart!  You live.  But my life has long beenin Death's hands so that I might serve the dead.		
A4755	Your power, great Zeus—what human overstepping can check it?  Yours is power that neither Sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods can defeat.  Unaged through time,you rule by your power and dwell thereby in the brilliant splendor of Olympus.  And through the future, both near and distant, as through the past, shall this law prevail:  nothing that is vast comes to the life of mortals without ruin.		
A4764	Father, the gods implant reason in men, the highest of all things that we call our own.		
A4766	For if any man thinks that he alone is wise—that in speech or in mind he has no peer—such a soul, when laid open, is always found empty.No, even when a man is wise, it brings him no shame to learn many things, and not to be too rigid.		
A4767	For if even from me, a younger man, a worthy thought may be supplied,by far the best thing, I believe, would be for men to be all-wise by nature.  Otherwise—since most often it does not turn out that way—it is good to learn in addition from those who advise you well.

You see how the trees that stand beside the torrential streams created by a winter storm yield to it and save their branches, while the stiff and rigid perish root and all?And in the same way the pilot who keeps the sheet of his sail taut and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and voyages thereafter with his decking underwater.  Father, give way and allow a change from your rage.  For if even from me, a younger man, a worthy thought may be supplied,by far the best thing, I believe, would be for men to be all-wise by nature.  Otherwise—since most often it does not turn out that way—it is good to learn in addition from those who advise you well		
A4772	Creon Does not the city by tradition belong to the man in power? Haemon You would make a fine monarch in a desert.		
A4781	You have touched on my most bitter thoughtand moved my ever-renewed pity for my father and for the entire doom ordained for us, the famed house of Labdacus.  Oh, the horrors of our mother's bed!  Oh, the slumbers of the wretched mother at the sideof her own son, my own father!  What manner of parents gave me my miserable being!  It is to them that I go like this, accursed and unwed, to share their home.		
A4786	Think, therefore, on these things, my son.  All men are liable to err.But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not remain stubborn.  Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.		
A4790	by how much the most precious of our possessions is the power to reason wisely?		
A4794	A time not long to be delayed will reveal in your house wailing over men and over women.All the cities are stirred up in hostility, whose mangled corpses the dogs, or the wild beasts or some winged bird buried, carrying an unholy stench to the city that held each man's hearth.  There, now, are arrows for your heart, since you provoke me,launched at you, archer-like, in my anger.		
A4796	The moment, Creon, requires that you reason wisely.		
A4797	Think, therefore, on these things, my son.  All men are liable to err.But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not remain stubborn.  Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.  Concede the claim of the dead.  Do not kick at the fallen.What prowess is it to kill the dead all over again?  I have considered for your good, and what I advise is good.  The sweetest thing is to learn from a good advisor when his advice is to your profit		
A4801	O Leader of the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire, overseer of the chants in the night, son begotten of Zeus,appear, my king, with your attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance and sing you as Iacchus the Giver!		
A4803	poor boy, not here, but in Hades' palace, and having shown to mankind by how much the failure to reason wisely is the most severe of all afflictions assigned to man.		
A4804	Ah, the blunders of an unthinking mind, blunders of rigidity, yielding death!  Oh, you witnesses of the killers and the killed, both of one family!What misery arises from my reasonings!  Haemon, you have died after a young life, youngest and last of my sons!  O God!  You have departed not by your foolishness, but by my own!		
A4806	O harbor of Hades, hard to purify!Why, why do you ruin me?  Herald of evil, of grief, what word do you say?  Ah, you have done in a dead man anew!  What are you saying, boy?  What is this you report to meGod no!—what new slaughter, my wife's doom, is heaped upon this ruin?		
A4808	Creon Ah this guilt can never be fastened onto any other mortal so as to remove my own!  It was I, yes, I, who killed you, I the wretch.I admit the truth.  Lead me away, my servants, lead me from here with all haste, who am no more than a dead man!		
A4815	Staggered, he fell to the earth with a crash,torch in hand, a man possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate.  But his threats did not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed each their own dooms with hard blows,Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point.		
A4821	Ah, no!  Think, sister, how our fatherperished in hatred and infamy, when, because of the crimes that he himself detected, he smashed both his eyes with self-blinding hand;		
A4829	Go, then, if you so decide.  And of this be sure:  though your path is foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and true		
A4831	And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of Thebes, rule our dancing!		
A4839	Saved just now beyond hope and belief, I owe the gods great thanks.		
A4859	Take her away—now!  And when you have enshrouded her, as I proclaimed, in her covered tomb, leave her alone, deserted—let her decide whether she wishes to die or to live entombed in such a home.		
A4862	And Dryas's son, the Edonian king swift to rage, was tamed in recompense for his frenzied insults, when, by the will of Dionysus, he was shut in a rocky prison.  There the fierce and swelling force of his madness trickled away.That man came to know the god whom in his frenzy he had provoked with mockeries.  For he had sought to quell the god-inspired women and the Bacchanalian fire,and he angered the Muses who love the flute.		
A4863	All men are liable to err.But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not remain stubborn.  Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.

A4866	You will not live through many morecourses of the sun's swift chariot, before you will give in return one sprung from your own loins, a corpse in requital for corpses.		
A4869	We must not wage vain wars with necessity.		
A4870	Thebes of all cities you hold foremost in honor, together with your lightning-struck mother.And now when the whole city is held subject to a violent plague, come, we ask, with purifying feet over steep Parnassus,or over the groaning straits!		
A4871	Leader of the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire, overseer of the chants in the night, son begotten of Zeus,appear, my king, with your attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance and sing you as Iacchus the Giver!		
A4882	how well you prove your loyalty to our house		
A4884	bring vengeance for the murder of my father		
A4885	May the one who did that perish, if I may speak such a curse without breaking the gods' laws.		
A4886	you have come to relieve me in my troubles		
A4887	friends whose love responds to mine		
A4888	Courage, my daughter, courage		
A4889	Zeus in the skyis still mighty, and he sees and rules all.		
A4890	It is nevertheless with goodwill, like a true-hearted mother,that I dissuade you from begetting misery upon miseries		
A4891	I came, my child, mindful of your interests no less than my own		
A4894	In such a state of affairs, then, friends, there is no room for self-restraint or for reverence.  Rather, in these dire straits there is much need to pursue a dire course.		
A4902	Chrysothemis		
A4903	I will fall, if need be, while honoring  my father.		
A4906	Still, sister, do yourself this service and help me, and him, too, that most beloved of all men, who rests in Hades' domain, our shared father		
A4907	I will.  In regard to a just deed, it is unreasonable for two people to argue, but reasonable to jump to action		
A4908	She, too, will come, she of many hands and many feet who lurks in her terrible ambush,the bronze-shod Erinys		
A4925	May I yet see you live exalted in might and wealth above your enemies by as much as you now dwell beneath their hand		
A4926	For I have found you enjoying no prosperous estate, yetfor observance of nature's highest laws you win the noblest prize by your reverence toward Zeus.		
A4932	Therefore accept me into this abode of yours—me, a nothing, into your nothingness,—so that I  may dwell with you hereafter below.  For when you were on earth, we shared equally, and now I wish to die and not to be left out of your grave,since I see that the dead are relieved of pain.		
A4933	Remember, Electra, you are the child of a mortal father, and Orestes was mortal.  Therefore do not grieve too much.  Death is a debt which all of us must pay.		
A4934	Ah, pity for your unwed, ill-fated life!		
A4935	What pity, then, for this miserable fortune!		
A4936	O frame dishonorably, godlessly wasted!		
A4937	Orestes Unfortunate girl, how seeing you stirs my pity! Electra Then know that you are the first who ever pitied me. Orestes Yes,  for I alone have come and been pained by your troubles .		
A4940	Chorus We see him, daughter, and for this happy turn of fortune a tear of joy trickles from our eyes.		
A4941	You have told me of a grace higher still than the first, if a god brought you to our house;I acknowledge in it the work of the divine.		
A4947	after first adoring the shrines of my father'sgods, the keepers of these gates		
A4948	show what rewards the gods bestow on humans in return for their impiety!		
A4953	Be sure that I will gladly give you all my help.  I would be hard-hearted indeed if I did not pity such suppliants as these.		
A4954	It is not because we rank you with the gods		
A4955	On, best of mortals, uplift our state! On, guard your fame, since now this land calls you savior on account of your former zeal.		
A4956	since if you are to rule this land just as you do now, it is better to be lord of men than of a wasteland.Neither walled town nor ship is anything, if it is empty and no men dwell within.		
A4957	my soul is in pain at once for the city, for myself, and for you.		
A4958	Thus you are not awakening me from sleep: no, be sure that I have wept many tears, wandered far and wide in my thought.		
A4960	The sorrow that I bear for these is more than for my own life.		
A4961	My children, let us rise.  What we came to seek, this man promises of his own accord.		
A4962	First I call on you, daughter of Zeus, immortal Athena,and on your sister, Artemis, guardian of our earth, who sits on her glorious throne above the circle of our market-place, and on far-shooting Apollo: oh shine forth for me, my three-fold help against death!If ever before you drove a fiery pest from our borders to stop ruin rushing upon our city, come now also!		
A4963	Whoever knowsby whom Laius son of Labdacus was slain, I order him to declare all to me.  And if he is afraid, I order him to remove the danger of indictment from his path by denouncing himself: he will suffer no other punishment, but will only leave this land, unhurt.If anyone knows the assassin to be an alien, from another land, let him not keep silent.  I will reward him, and my thanks shall rest with him besides.		
A4967	From which, great prophet, we find you to be our protector and only savior.		
A4968	I order you to abide by you own decree, and from this day forth not to speak to these men or to me: you are the accursed defiler of this land.		
A4972	But rather I, Oedipus the ignorant, stopped her, having attained the answer through my wit alone, untaught by birds.		
A4978	The son of Zeus is springing upon him with fiery lightning, and with him come the dread unerring Fates		
A4980	truly I do not desire my full term of years, when I must bear such blame as this.  The wrong of this rumortouches me not in one point alone, but has the largest scope, if I am to be called a traitor in the city, a traitor by you and by my friends.		
A4983	No mind will become false while it is wise		
A4984	It is not just to judge bad men good at random,or good men bad		
A4987	Insolence, once vainly stuffed with wealththat is not proper or good for it, when it has scaled the topmost ramparts, is hurled to a dire doom, where one's feet cannot serve to good advantage		
A4988	I will always hold the god as our protector.		
A5001	For my part, I pity him when I think how,with no one to care for him, and seeing no companion's face, but suffering eternally alone, he is plagued by fierce disease and bewildered by each need as it arises.How, how does he endure his bitter fate?		
A5002	pity you		
A5009	I truly marvel how—how in the world—as he listened in solitude to the breakers rushing around him,he kept his hold upon a life so full of grief.		
A5010	Here, he alone was his own neighbor, powerless to walk, with no one in the land to be his companion while he suffered—no one to whom he could cry out a lament that would be answeredfor the plague that gnawed his flesh and drained his blood—no one to lull with healing herbs gathered from the nourishing earth the burning blood which oozed from the ulcers of hisenvenomed foot, whenever the torment attacked him		
A5011	Ah, poor wretch!  Poor man, truly for all your sufferings!		
A5012	Shall I support you, or somehow offer a helping hand?		
A5013	My heart has long been aching for your load of pain.		
A5014	Take heart, we will remain. Philoctetes Will you? Neoptolemus Be sure of it.		
A5015	I could never have expected this, son—that you would have the patience to wait so tenderly upon my sufferings by staying close beside me and helping to relieve me.		
A5016	O Zeus, what shall I do?  Must I be twice found base—by disloyal silence, as well as by shameful speech?		
A5018	A startling pity for him has come upon me—and not now for the first time, but long ago.		
A5020	if the gods care for justice.  But I know that they do care for it,		
A5021	O, fatherland, and you watchful gods, bring your vengeance, bring your vengeance on them all after so long, if at all you pity me!		
A5022	The boy commands our ship.  Whatever he says to you, that is our answer also.		
A5024	Aim your hate-filled, baneful curse elsewhere, since I prefer that you not reject my friendship.		
A5025	A man must always assert what is right.  But, when he has done so, he must not let loose malignant, stinging taunts.		
A5029	It is true that men are compelled to bear the fortunes given by the gods;		
A5030	For you, certainly, since I am your friend and speak in friendship.		
A5031	Neoptolemus What if they ravage my country? Philoctetes I will be there— Neoptolemus And what aid will you render? Philoctetes —And with the shafts of Heracles— Neoptolemus What? Philoctetes —I will keep them away. Neoptolemus Then say your farewell to this island, and leave with me.		
A5033	But of this be mindful, when you plunder the land—that you show reverence towards the gods.  Do this because Father Zeus regards all else as of less account, and because Piety does not die along with mortals.  Whether they are alive or dead, their piety does not perish.		
A5034	like twin lions with the same quarry, each of you must guard the other's life

A5037	Yet, as the child began to cry, begging her father to consent, the father, who loved his child very much, in order to comfort her, replied that he would order a pair of boots to be made of iron, and hang them up until the boots would rust to pieces with age, when he would marry the mistress

A5043	The little girl went away crying and bewailing her lot; but the cow comforted her		
A5044	The good cow after that took out all the crumbs from the loaf by making a small hole with one of her horns, and then stopped the aperture, and gave the girl the loaf back again entirely

A5070	As soon as the father consented to her keeping it

A5082	"and then she would give the ""Hearth-Cat"" a new dress."		
A5083	"""Oh! my daughter, you will have to marry me, because your mother, before she died, expressed a wish that I should marry whoever this ring would fit."		
A5086	Listen to me, royal lady, go and tell your father that you will only marry him on condition that he buys you a dress of the colour of the stars in the heavens.		
A5087	Well, father, I shall marry you when you bring me a dress of the colour of the stars in the heavens.		
A5089	you must now ask him to bring you a dress of the colour of the flowers that grow in the fields.		
A5090	The princess again went to her father and told him that she could only marry him on condition of his bringing her a robe of the colour of wild flowers		
A5092	Ask your father now for a robe of various colours		
A5094	Royal lady, you must now send for a carpenter and order him to make you a dress of wood; get inside it and go to the palace of the king who lives yonder, who requires a servant to tend the ducks.		
A5095	The princess, greatly distressed, shut herself up in a room which had the window looking into the garden, and gave vent to her grief		
A5097	"""Indeed there was no one else there but myself in disguise."""		
A5099	God, preserve me!		
A5100	divining rod, by the virtue that God gave you, send me here the best royal carriage, which is the very one that took the king to the feast		
A5106	The princess recounted all the events of her life and the king married her.		
A5107	The king next sent for the little old woman who had given her the wand, to come and live in the palace,		
A5108	"""Why do you weep, royal lady?"""		
A5111	she informed them that she was from the land of the towel.		
A5113	The old woman was blind of one eye, and the boy went on the blind side and stole a cake, because he felt so hungry.		
A5115	She went on the side of the old woman's blind eye and stole another of her cakes.		
A5118	The children, instead of their little fingers, showed her the tail of a cat they had found inside the box.		
A5119	You are gathering sticks, my children, to heat the oven, but you do not know that the old hag wants to bake you in it.		
A5120	"Sit you here, little granny, that we may first see you dance in the oven."""		
A5121	but the very moment the children saw her on the peel they thrust the peel into the oven with the witch upon it.		
A5122	The boys with their long hook, from the top of the roof, fished up the warm cakes one after the other, as the old hag placed them on the dish.		
A5123	The children took possession of the shed and all it contained.		
A5124	These brothers were consecrated to St. Peter		
A5125	No, no, old lady, you get upon it first, and one can then easily learn how it is to be done.		
A5126	Saint Peter, come to our help!		
A5127	Saint Peter came,		
A5128	pushed the old hag into the oven, stirred the fire, and shut the oven door		
A5129	Saint Peter came, pushed the old hag into the oven, stirred the fire, and shut the oven door.		
A5130	After this the boys continued to partake of the remaining cakes very comfortably.		
A5131	The children did as they were bid		
A5133	the boy went on the blind side and stole a cake, because he felt so hungry		
A5138	"""You are gathering sticks, my children, to heat the oven, but you do not know that the old hag wants to bake you in it."""		
A5139	"She further told them that the old witch meant to order them to stand on the baker's peel, saying: ""Stand on this peel, my little pets, that I may see you dance in the oven; but that they were to ask her to sit upon it herself first, that so they might learn the way to do it"		
A5140	"She further told them that the old witch meant to order them to stand on the baker's peel, saying: ""Stand on this peel, my little pets, that I may see you dance in the oven; but that they were to ask her to sit upon it herself first, that so they might learn the way to do it."		
A5141	"""Sit you here, little granny, that we may first see you dance in the oven."""		
A5142	the very moment the children saw her on the peel they thrust the peel into the oven with the witch upon it. The old hag gave a great start, and was burnt to a cinder immediately after. The children took possession of the shed and all it contained.		
A5143	"The brothers said one to another, ""Let us get upon the roof."""		
A5144	They made a very long hook-stick, and got upon the roof.		
A5147	"""No, no, old lady, you get upon it first, and one can then easily learn how it is to be done."""		
A5148	the moment they saw her upon the peel. Saint Peter came, pushed the old hag into the oven, stirred the fire, and shut the oven door.		
A5149	"""Saint Peter, come to our help!"" cried out the brothers"		
A5152	The children replied to the witch as the good fay had instructed them		
A5154	which they replied that there was not; and on asking the same question of her servants they made the same answer.		
A5155	"""Be it known to your august majesty that there is."""		
A5157	"Your highness is not aware for what purpose we have brought you here; but we shall do you no harm."""		
A5158	They then begged of the princess to flee to some distant part and never to return to the city, so as not to betray them.		
A5161	and at night they also supped together.		
A5162	, but the man opening a cupboard showed her a complete suit of a country-woman's clothes		
A5163	replied that she had not, because she had seen a man approach as though he wished to speak to her,		
A5166	the marriage was celebrated with great pomp, and they all lived very happily.		
A5167	"There was a very vain Queen who, turning towards her maids of honour, asked them, ""Is there a face more beautiful than mine?"" To which they replied that there was not; and on asking the same question of her servants they made the same answer."		
A5170	The queen, on hearing this, desired to know who it could be		
A5171	the chamberlain informed her that it was her daughter		
A5174	"""Your highness is not aware for what purpose we have brought you here; but we shall do you no harm."""		
A5175	They found a small bitch and killed her, and cut her tongue off, telling the princess that they had done this to take it to her majesty, for she had commanded them to behead her, and to take her back the tongue		
A5176	the man, who had seen her hiding away, called her to him. He told her not to be ashamed; and they both afterwards dined at the table, and at night they also supped together.		
A5179	The princess replied that she would like to remain his daughter. The man then arranged a separate bed for himself and they each retired to rest. They lived in this way very happily.		
A5180	the man opening a cupboard showed her a complete suit of a country-woman's clothes		
A5184	When the man saw her in the evening and asked her whether she had enjoyed her walk the maiden replied that she had not, because she had seen a man approach as though he wished to speak to her, and therefore she did not wish ever to go out again.		
A5185	When the man saw her in the evening and asked her whether she had enjoyed her walk the maiden replied that she had not, because she had seen a man approach as though he wished to speak to her, and therefore she did not wish ever to go out again		
A5187	The queen immediately commanded a proclamation to be issued to the effect that the country lass who had seen the prince should at once proceed to the palace, for which she would be recompensed and marry the prince.		
A5189	The guard went and knocked at the door, and told the maiden that her majesty sent for her to the palace, and that she would be well rewarded if she came.		
A5190	When she saw the man again in the evening she related to him all that had passed		
A5192	When the guard returned next day for the answer, the girl told him that she did not dare inform him of her decision. The guard told her to say whatever she liked, that he would repeat it to the queen. The girl then told him what the man had advised her to say.		
A5193	The girl then told him what the man had advised her to say.		
A5194	The guard then recounted all that the girl had said		
A5197	She told the maiden that seeing that her son the prince was so greatly in love with her she begged of her, if such was pleasing to her, to consent to marry the prince, as otherwise he would most certainly die		
A5198	if such was pleasing to her, to consent to marry the prince		
A5199	When the queen saw all this she was very much astonished, and made many apologies for having summoned the girl to the palace.		
A5200	The maiden was willing and acceded to the request of the queen		
A5202	had a very good daughter		
A5203	entrusted her stepdaughter with the hardest duties such as cleaning the kitchen, tidying the dishes,		
A5204	Cinderella Cat, who stayed behind, began to cry		
A5205	she made a pumpkin turn into a coach with horses, a mouse and lizards into a coachman and lackeys, and old dresses into beautiful rich dresses;		
A5207	it turned out that the shoe fitted Cinderella		
A5209	she lost a shoe, which the prince kept.		
A5211	who had a very good daughter (Cinderella Cat)

A5216	he shoe fitted Cinderella		
A5221	they saw her waving and he came to fetch her		
A5223	will you stay here tonight, because there is a ball here		
A5224	"""I don't care about that; I'm going, but that's where my old lady is"		
A5229	It was Horse's skin		
A5231	and Horse's skin threw to her the ring that the king had given her without her seeing it		
A5234	The nurse was taking the broth to the king, and Horse's skin threw to her the ring that the king had given her without her seeing it.		
A5235	"""It was Horse's skin."""		
A5237	"""And what about your daughters?"		
A5242	The boy waited and waited		
A5243	she would also not give her father any orange		
A5244	he would not give her oranges because she had killed her,		
A5245	she would also not give her father any orange because he had eaten her		
A5247	she gave him all of them because he had saved her.		
A5249	the hand of a child

A5259	her brother asked for an orange, and she gave him all of them because he had saved her		
A5260	he would not give her oranges		
A5261	May St. Anthony be your godfather.		
A5263	I'll give you some biscuits.		
A5264	The little ones came in		
A5266	Saint Anthony came, and warned them		
A5268	As soon as the old woman began to burn, two wolf-dogs came out of her eyes, and remained at the obedience of the children, hunting all the game for them.		
A5269	The old woman starts to jump on the shovel,		
A5270	the little ones pushed her inside the oven,		
A5271	It was a poor boy, with two little dogs that he was carrying.		
A5277	and set the princess free.		
A5278	seeing that they were fat,		
A5279	May St. Anthony be your godfather		
A5280	The little ones came in;		
A5282	The godson of Saint Anthony		
A5283	put the tail of a mouse he had caught through the hole, and the old woman let them stay longer		
A5285	Saint Anthony came,		
A5286	Jump you, aunt, first, so that we may know how it is		
A5287	the little ones pushed her inside the oven		
A5288	the little ones pushed her inside the oven, saying:   By the grace of Saint Anthony Carry this devil to hell.		
A5289	remained at the obedience of the children, hunting all the game for them.		
A5290	free		
A5291	Now the king gave his daughter in marriage to whomsoever would save her.		
A5292			
A5293	godson of Saint Anthony		
A5294	, hunting all the game for them.		
A5296	with two little dogs that he was carrying.		
A5298	That's him, my father. That's the one		
A5299	the godson of Saint Anthony		
A5303	he marriage was made with the princess, and it was the godson of Saint Anthony who made all his family happy		
A5304	The children ate chestnuts		
A5306	the children, seeing the witch's confusion, laughed		
A5307	"""Blessed be Our Lady and St. Joseph,"""		
A5308	and threw the witch into the oven.		
A5309	The children, instead of putting their little fingers in, put in the tail of a little mouse that they had found in the chest.		
A5310	"for you are already very fat"""		
A5312	she also made a little hole in the gourd for the children to drink the wine		
A5313	"The children said, ""Blessed be Our Lady and St. Joseph,"" and threw the witch into the oven."		
A5314	you will say: Blessed be Our Lady and St. Joseph, and throw her in the oven		
A5315	Now the children were very hungry, so they very cleverly took the fritters		
A5316	Blessed be Our Lady and St. Joseph,		
A5318	you are already very fat		
A5319	throw the shells on the path, so that they could be guided by them when they returned home		
A5320	the old woman made a little hole in the bread, took out the crumb and gave it to the children		
A5321	the witch is going to heat up the oven to roast you		
A5322	took the money that the witch had in the house		
A5323	The witch was badly wounded and died		
A5324	The witch was badly wounded and died, and the children returned to their father's house, and took the money that the witch had in the house		
A5325	they saw a light; they drew nearer, and saw a house by the light; they went in		
A5326	Just now I saw a prettier woman at a window doing her hair		
A5327	The servants took pity on her and left her		
A5328	If anyone is there, let him appear		
A5329	Now don't worry; you'll stay with us, and we'll take care that you, who are our sister.		
A5332	they loved her very much and treated her.		
A5334	I'll pay you well.		
A5341	The servants took pity on her and left her.		
A5342	She went inside and made supper,		
A5344	my brothers give me as many shoes as I want;		
A5346	and afterwards she wanted to have her killed, but she couldn't do it.		
A5352	The oldest of the two daughters was very fond of giving alms to the poor		
A5354	The girl gave him some old trousers and an old jacket that belonged to her father		
A5357	The prince felt for the child		
A5359	and took her to the palace,		
A5360	and suspected that he had something hidden there		
A5361	One day, the Prince forgot the key, and the mother entered the room		
A5362	especially when she noticed that she had no hands		
A5363	"""I'm very sorry for that"		
A5370	and immediately wrote his mother ordering her to kill the monster and the girl without hands.		
A5373	The prince’s mother cried a lot		
A5374	. She hid the child into a basket and the poor mother left to go as far as possible from the palace.		
A5376	She took the child and thanked God		
A5378	and lived off her sewing work.		
A5380	I stayed at an inn		
A5381	The Prince had the inn proprietors arrested, locked in a dungeon		
A5383	go to that gentleman and ask for his blessing:		
A5384	asked the prince for his blessing		
A5386	the ones who had replaced the letter were killed.		
A5387	Everyone was outraged with the two monsters.		
A5388	The girl gave him some old trousers and an old jacket that belonged to her father.		
A5389	. The girl gave him some old trousers and an old jacket that belonged to her father.		
A5394	The prince felt for the child,		
A5396	who was very beautiful, and took her to the palace,		
A5403	The next day, the ones who had replaced the letter were killed. Everyone was outraged with the two monsters.		
A5404	the ones who had replaced the letter were killed		
A5406	"She heard a voice:  ""Put the stumps into the water…"" She did what the voice told her to do, and when she took her arms out of the water, she had once more her dear hands. She took the child and thanked God."		
A5407	"""Obviously, I am. Only a cruel man would ask for his beautiful child and the mother of that child to be killed…"""		
A5408	"I have it here with me."""		
A5409	When the prince read the letter, he got very angry and immediately wrote his mother ordering her to kill the monster and the girl without hands.		
A5411	"""Do you come from far away?"" asked the innkeeper."		
A5412	The Prince had the inn proprietors arrested, locked in a dungeon,		
A5413	"and ask for his blessing: he is your  father."""		
A5415	The child went running and asked the prince for his blessin		
A5416	The postman told them everything that had happened there.		
A5417	They agreed immediately, husband and wife, to exchange the letter for a different one		
A5418	She told the boy’s mother the answer she had received from the prince. Then the poor martyr asked her to not kill the boy as she would take him away around the world.		
A5421	the school of a teacher who treated her very well and gave her honey soups.		
A5423	she asked her father to marry her teacher because she was a good friend of his.		
A5425	The little cow with the sticks took the crumb of the bread for the girl to eat, and when she drank the water, she filled the bowl again with her drool.		
A5428	gave a piece of bread to the little dog		
A5429	The girl cleaned the house very well, put the pan on the fire,		
A5430	Behind the door Is the one who gave me bread.		
A5431	and fated her to be the most beautiful face in the world, and that when she spoke she would spit pearls out of her mouth, and they also gave her a magic wand.		
A5432	and immediately fated her to be the ugliest face in the world; that when she spoke she stammered a lot, and was humpbacked.		
A5433	Behind the door Is the one who hit me with a stick		
A5434	he ran to fetch the little shoe, and was astonished at how small it was.		
A5436	the stepmother was so angry that she threw herself down from the window and died broken.		
A5438	THE SATIN SLIPPER		
A5439	a teacher who treated her very well and gave her honey soups		
A5440	gave her honey soups		
A5445	In this way they deceived their stepmother		
A5446	The girl cried and cried		
A5448	n went to wash her bowels in the brook;		
A5449	she hid behind the door		
A5450	The girl told what happened, but changing everything, that she had messed up the house, broken the dishes, and beaten the little dog.		
A5452	The girl asked the magic wand to give her a dress the colour of heaven and all trimmed with gold stars,		
A5453	who remained to make dinner		
A5458	The girl cleaned the house very well, put the pan on the fire, and gave a piece of bread to the little dog		
A5459	the prince was not ashamed to accompany the shoemaker's son everywhere.		
A5460	they always played together,		
A5461	the prince heard of this he fled from the palace and went into the world in search of his friend		
A5464	a king's son who was very friendly with a shoemaker's son;		
A5466	but he asks him to delay his rigor, to tell the whole court what happened		
A5468	but full of confidence in the power of friendship		
A5469	when the prince turned to the place where his children were, he found them very merry and playing, with only a little red ribbon around their necks.		
A5472	the prince and the maiden fell asleep, but the cobbler's son stayed awake in case something happened		
A5473	And he who hears this and does not remain silent will turn to marble.		
A5474	And he who hears this and does not remain silent will turn to marble		
A5476	knowing that it was the advice of the cobbler's son that made him return home, he gave him leave to live in the palace in the company of his friend.		
A5478	but the prince always consented		
A5479	As he had expected this, he unloaded a sharp blow and killed the monster,		
A5480	the boy began to relate everything, and gradually became marble		
A5483	There was once a king's son who was very friendly with a shoemaker's son		
A5490	that he would give him pardon and leave to marry the maiden		
A5491	the king was very glad when he saw his son, forgave him		
A5492	nowing that it was the advice of the cobbler's son that made him return home, he gave him leave to live in the palace in the company of his friend.		
A5495	asked the cobbler's son what he wanted as a gift on the wedding day.		
A5496	He said he only wanted one thing, and that was to sleep in the same room on the night of the engagement		
A5497	They were all sorry that such fidelity was so badly repaid		
A5500	The prince hesitated,		
A5502	They were never parted again, and from then on they all lived very happily.		
A5503	Girl, don't pick up that rattle; it could put some dirt under your nails, and cause great pain.		
A5504	It was the girl who had fainted, unconscious.		
A5505	On top of a box was a rattle with tow, and the girl took it to amuse herself:		
A5510	and by chance, without knowing how,		
A5511	The queen was already suspicious of her son's absences, and was trying to see if she could find out anything.		
A5512	the prince had it made on purpose		
A5516	Eat, eat, it's yours.		
A5519	got up to see what it was.		
A5520	He saw the queen wanting to strangle her daughter-in-law.		
A5522	The queen was condemned, and the page sentenced to death		
A5527	Full of curiosity, the picker wanted to see what was inside		
A5529	the unhappy girl, full of curiosity, wanted to see what was in that room		
A5530	saw that it had a stain of blood on it.		
A5533	; but as she was very clever, what would she remember! She made a straw doll, put on her dresses, put it on the belvedere, and got into the barrel,		
A5535	So the daughters all returned to their father's house;		
A5536	d she ran, and ran, until she reached her father's house		
A5538	fell down from the lookout, dying instantly bursting;		
A5540	"""Since you have dared to penetrate my palace, I order you to bring me the first thing that appears to you when you arrive at your house, and if you do not comply you are certain to die in three days""."		
A5543	Then, without a word, he cut off the head of the poor girl, and laid her down in the same room where she had entered.		
A5544	The sisters advised her to clean the key, so that the Moor would not know what she had done.		
A5549	It is the same thing that had happened to his sister.		
A5550	. One day she asked him to take a barrel of sugar to her father, for he was very poor;		
A5552	then she saw two bowls with the names of the sisters, took their heads, put them together with the bodies, and poured the blood over their necks; and soon the sisters were alive again.		
A5556	Then, without a word, he cut off the head of the poor girl, and laid her down in the same room where she had entered		
A5558	The girl went into the room of the dead and saw the beheaded sisters,		
A5560	. One day she asked him to take a barrel of sugar to her father, for he was very poor; the Moor said yes		
A5561	She then put one of her sisters inside the barrel, and told the Moor to go quickly		
A5562	and she ran, and ran, until she reached her father's house		
A5563	and in the same way sent the other sister.		
A5564	; but as she was very clever		
A5565	She made a straw doll, put on her dresses, put it on the belvedere, and got into the barrel,		
A5567	So the daughters all returned to their father's house		
A5571	they rendered every day to the Almighty, they fervently implored and begged Him to complete the Eden of their life		
A5572	God, certainly moved by compassion, granted them a daughter,		
A5574	for all her colleagues to predict for the new-born child all the fortunes and a bright future.		
A5576	imposing great penalties, with confiscation of goods and loss of life for all those who infringed it		
A5577	the king and the queen went out for a walk		
A5578	The princess, caring for nothing,		
A5580	the girl came to see it and was so curious		
A5582	the girl heard nothing and heeded nothing, so that when she arrived at the palace she began to spin.		
A5583	a kindly young man,		
A5589	the prince, very compassionate, tried to make her feel better		
A5590	with the most persuasive words, making her see that she had lost the ones who adored her so much, but that, in compensation, she had found in him an affectionate spouse who would remedy such a cruel misfortune with affection and with his love, never extinguished		
A5591	She deeply regretted the loss of her parents because of her disobedience		
A5592	the prince revealed to her the whole truth, explaining how long it had been like that		
A5600	very restless, she would never stop and nothing would stop with her.		
A5601	to each state their oracle		
A5602	and it goes without saying that they were religiously listened to, especially by the parents.		
A5603	for all her colleagues to predict for the new-born child all the fortunes and a bright future		
A5604	she will put a spindle in her right hand that will make her and all the palace staff fall asleep for a hundred years,		
A5608	only obeying the impulses of her playful genius,		
A5609	went out and arrived at  the house of a septuagenarian who was spinning against the expressly forbidden order		
A5610	for fear of punishment		
A5611	the girl heard nothing and heeded nothing,		
A5612	a kindly young man		
A5614	yet after struggling with the beasts and a thousand obstacles he managed to enter;		
A5616	the Lord walked through the world		
A5617	he wouldn't give the oranges to them because his father had forbidden it		
A5618	Then Saint Peter and the Lord passed by,		
A5619	go to an orange tree and eat as many as you like.		
A5622	ask him for anything you want, and he'll give you everything		
A5623	Go up to the orange trees and eat as many as you like.		
A5625	Do you want salvation?  - Yes, Lord, I do,		
A5626	The Lord took a bagpipe out of his pocket and gave it to the boy		
A5627	The boy said that if they didn't eat it was because they didn't want to		
A5628	he had a little bagpipe that made them dance and they didn't eat anything.		
A5629	The reed fell down  The oven crumbled down, the boy died,  and the whole family died.		
A5630	the Lord walked through the world,		
A5631	Then Saint Peter and the Lord passed by, and Saint Peter said:		
A5632	he'll give you everything.		
A5633	but go to an orange tree and eat as many as you like.		
A5634	Now ask for whatever you want.		
A5635	The father, when he saw this, scolded the boy.		
A5638	Oh woman, do you want to know why the boy won't let the sheep eat?		
A5639	He said he wouldn't give the oranges to them because his father had forbidden it.		
A5640	The boy said that if they didn't eat it was because they didn't want to; that he had a little bagpipe that made them dance and they didn't eat anything.		
A5642	she was very sorry that she was so beautiful, because everyone wanted her.		
A5643	She asked her father to give her a blue and grey dress and her father gave it to her.		
A5644	; her father did as she wished		
A5645	went from there to serve as a maid.		
A5647	The inhabitants of the city gathered to make a great feast that lasted three days		
A5651	I'm from the land of the boot.		
A5652	I’m from the land of the cane.		
A5653	I’m from the land of the towel.		
A5657	Beautiful White told the reason for all this		
A5658	and her father gave it to her.		
A5659	She got the dress right away.		
A5660	her father did as she wished.		
A5664	— Where are you from?		
A5665	— I'm from the land of the boot		
A5667	Where are you from?		
A5673	the king's disease,		
A5674	- Take these cakes to your grandmother.		
A5677	she asked him, as he was a doctor, to prescribe her some herbs that were around there.		
A5678	She did so immediately and picked them and took them to her grandmother's house.		
A5679	He dressed himself in the same dresses as the old woman		
A5680	it looks like you have big ears today?		
A5682	And why do you have such big eyes?		
A5684	I'll go and see if she wants anything.		
A5685	in their place he put two large stones and baked the wolf's belly with a large needle.		
A5686	he fell into the water and drowned.		
A5687	They ate the cakes.		
A5688	Take these cakes to your grandmother.		
A5691	As soon as the wolf got to the old woman's house he took the key out of the hole and opened the door, reached the old woman's bed and swallowed it		
A5693	Hearing this, he said to himself: - Maybe the old woman is worse		
A5694	I'll go and see if she wants anything		
A5698	had sworn to always stand by each other in the works that fortune would destine them		
A5699	Pedrito was to accompany him		
A5701	to save the princess		
A5702	The princess shall pass over a bridge; she shall pass and the bridge will fall		
A5703	will ask for water, and if she is given it and drinks it, she will die		
A5704	The princess will feel sleepy on the way and will ask to rest; but while she sleeps she will be bitten by a serpent and will die right there		
A5705	, he tried to warn Prince Pedro of the great misfortunes that awaited the princess		
A5707	Pedro's pain was so great		
A5709	As soon as Pedrito saw this, he went to a certain sorceress so that she could help him in such an affliction		
A5710	his prize was to marry a princess		
A5713	his prize was to marry a princess, Pedro's sister,		
A5715	"Whoever hears and tells this Shall turn to stone""."		
A5716	had sworn to always stand by each other		
A5720	"Whoever hears and tells this Shall turn to stone"".»"		
A5721	but at the same time that Pedrito was becoming a man Pedro was becoming a statue.		
A5722	at the same time that Pedrito was becoming a man Pedro was becoming a statue.		
A5723	take its blood and pour it over the statue of Peter and he will come back to life.»		
A5728	kill it by the neck, take its blood and pour it over the statue of Peter and he will come back to life.»		
A5730	a prince called Pedro who had a breastfeeding sibling called Pedrito		
A5731	And at this they came down and beat the messenger, who died.		
A5733	The king had promised to give the princess to whoever cured her		
A5735	then the devils came up and said to one another:		
A5736	and the owner would give four crusades in silver to whoever would draw the water out.		
A5737	the snake that she has would come out right away,		
A5739	who was watching		
A5741	THE ONE WHO GOD HELPS		
A5743	the one who God helps		
A5744	he who  God helps		
A5746	the one who God helps  is better off		
A5747	there's a little light shining so far away; I'm going to stay there under that house		
A5748	if you took a basin of milk and turned the princess upside down with her mouth in the basin, the snake that she has would come out right away, which is bad for her		
A5749	who was watchin		
A5750	He received the four crusades		
A5751	if he wanted to marry her or if he wanted half of the king's income and a horse to ride		
A5752	The king did so		
A5754	spiegate da me con istorica purità, e con intera fedeltà registrate		
A5756	Cominciò questi ne' prim'anni della sua fanciullezza a dar saggio della vivacità del suo ingegno, poiché nell'ore di spasso esercitavasi per lo più in fabbricarsi di propria mano varii strumenti e machinette, con imitare e porre in piccol modello ciò che vedeva d'artifizioso, come di molini, galere, et anco d'ogni altra macchina ben volgare. In difetto di qualche parte necessaria ad alcuno de' suoi fanciulleschi artifizii suppliva con l'invenzione, servendosi di stecche di balena in vece di molli di ferro, o d'altro in altra parte, secondo gli suggeriva il bisogno, adattando alla macchina nuovi pensieri e scherzi di moti, purché non restasse imperfetta e che vedesse operarla.		
A5757	In difetto di qualche parte necessaria ad alcuno de' suoi fanciulleschi artifizii suppliva con l'invenzione,		
A5758	il giovane, conoscendo la tenuità del suo stato e volendosi pur sollevare, si propose di supplire alla povertà della sua sorte con la propria assiduità nelli studii; che perciò datosi alla lettura delli autori latini di prima classe, giunse da per sé stesso a quell'erudizione nelle lettere umane, della quale si mostrò poi in ogni privato congresso, ne' circoli e nell'accademie, riccamente adornato, valendosene mirabilmente con ogni qualità di persona, in qualunque materia, morale o scientifica, seria o faceta, che fosse proposta.		
A5764	In questo mentre con la sagacità del suo ingegno inventò quella semplicissima e regolata misura del tempo per mezzo del pendulo,		
A5765	e facendone esperienze esattissime, si accertò dell'egualità delle sue vibrazioni,		
A5767	della quale invenzione si valse poi in varie esperienze e misure di tempi e moti, e fu il primo che l'applicasse alle osservazioni celesti, con incredibile acquisto nell'astronomia e geografia.		
A5768	Di qui s'accorse che gl'effetti della natura, quantunque apparischin minimi et in niun conto osservabili, non devon mai dal filosofo disprezzarsi, ma tutti egualmente e grandemente stimarsi; essendo perciò solito dire che la natura operava molto col poco, e che le sue operazioni eran tutte in pari grado maravigliose.		
A5772	sovvennegli un nuovo modo esattissimo di poter scoprire il furto di quell'orefice nella corona d'oro di Hierone : et allora scrisse la fabbrica et uso di quella sua bilancetta, per la quale s'ha cognizione delle gravità in specie di diverse materie e della mistione o lega de' metalli,		
A5774	Con questi et altri suoi ingegnosi trovati,		
A5776	inventò quello ch'in tal materia si vede scritto nell'Appendice impressa alla fine de' suoi Dialoghi delle due Nuove Scienze della meccanica e del moto locale, con gran satisfazione e maraviglia del medesimo Sig.r Guidubaldo, il quale per così acute invenzioni l'esaltò a segno appresso il Ser.mo Gran Duca Ferdinando Primo e l'Eccel.mo Principe Don Giovanni de' Medici, ch'in breve divenne a loro gratissimo e familiare:		
A5778	per mezzo d'esperienze		
A5780	dimostrando ciò con replicate esperienze, fatte dall'altezza del Campanile di Pisa con l'intervento delli altri lettori e filosofi e di tutta la scolaresca;		
A5782	giudizio dato da esso sopra una tal macchina, d'invenzione d'un eminente soggetto, proposta per votar la darsina di Livorno, alla quale il Galileo con fondamenti meccanici e con libertà filosofica aveva fatto pronostico di mal evento (come in effetto seguì),		
A5785	nel qual tempo inventò varie macchine in servizio della medesima Republica, con suo grandissimo onore et utile insieme, come dimostrano gl'amplissimi privilegi ottenuti da quella;		
A5786	essendo di esse tanto liberale donatore quanto fecondo compositore.		
A5787	In questi medesimi tempi ritrovò i termometri, cioè quelli strumenti di vetro, con acqua et aria, per distinguer le mutazioni di caldo e freddo e la varietà de' temperamenti de' luoghi;		
A5788	Circa l'anno 1597 inventò il suo mirabile compasso geometrico e militare,		
A5792	In questi medesimi tempi fece studio et osservazione particolare sopra la virtù della calamita		
A5793	trovò modo sicuro di armarne qualunque pezzo, che sostenesse di ferro ottanta e cento volte più che disarmato;		
A5796	il Capra per mezzo di queste sue abominevoli azzioni ne riportò il dovuto premio d'una perpetua ignominia,		
A5797	Non fu già valevole tal Difesa a reprimere l'audacia o la troppa confidenza di alcuni altri d'altre nazioni, i quali, allettati o traportati dalla novità e vaghezza dell'invenzione o dalla mirabil copia e facilità de' suoi usi, non esponessero alle stampe, come interamente lor proprio, questo ingegnoso compasso del Galileo, publicandolo, o con diverse inscrizioni in altra forma ridotto o con nuove linee et ad altri usi ampliato, senza pur far menzione del principale autore di tal strumento;		
A5798	Con questa sola relazione, tornando subito il Sig.r Galileo a Padova, si pose a specularne la fabbrica, quale immediatamente ritrovò la seguente notte: poiché il giorno appresso, componendo lo strumento nel modo che se lo aveva immaginato, non ostante l'imperfezione de' vetri che poté avere, ne vidde l'effetto desiderato,		
A5799	sopra le maggiori altezze della città fece vedere et osservare gl'oggetti in varie lontananze a' primi Senatori di quella Republica, con lor infinita maraviglia; e riducendo lo strumento continuamente a maggior perfezione, si risolse finalmente, con la solita prodigalità nel comunicare le sue invenzioni, di far libero dono di questa ancora al Ser.mo Principe o Doge Leonardo Donati et insieme a tutto 'l Senato Veneto, presentando con lo strumento una scrittura nella quale ei dichiarava la fabbrica, gl'usi e le maravigliose conseguenze che in terra e in mare da quello trar si potevano.		
A5800	sopra le maggiori altezze della città fece vedere et osservare gl'oggetti in varie lontananze a' primi Senatori di quella Republica, con lor infinita maraviglia;		
A5801	si risolse finalmente, con la solita prodigalità nel comunicare le sue invenzioni, di far libero dono di questa ancora al Ser.mo Principe o Doge Leonardo Donati et insieme a tutto 'l Senato Veneto,		
A5803	In gradimento di così nobil regalo fu immediatamente, con generosa dimostrazione della Ser.ma Republica, ne' 25 d'Agosto del 1609 ricondotto il Sig.r Galileo a vita sua alla medesima lettura, con più che triplicato stipendio del maggiore che fusse solito assegnarsi a' lettori di matematica.		
A5804	pensò ancora al modo di perfezionar assai più la nostra vista con fargli perfettamente discernere quelle minuzie le quali, benché situate in qualunque breve distanza dall'occhio, gli si rendono impercettibili; et allora inventò i microscopii d'un convesso e di un concavo, et insieme d'uno e di più convessi, applicandogli a scrupolosa osservazione de' minimi componenti delle materie e della mirabile struttura delle parti e membra delli insetti,		
A5805	conseguitala a gran segno, lasciando di rimirar gl'oggetti terreni, si rivolse a contemplazioni più nobili.		
A5806	E prima, riguardando il corpo lunare, lo scoperse di superficie ineguale, ripieno di cavità e prominenze a guisa della terra. Trovò che la Via Lattea e le nebulose altro non erano ch'una congerie di stelle fisse, che per la loro immensa distanza, o per la lor piccolezza rispetto all'altre, si rendevano impercettibili alla nuda e semplice vista. Vidde sparse per lo cielo altre innumerabili stelle fisse, state incognite all'antichità: e rivolgendosi a Giove con altro migliore strumento, ch'egli s'era nuovamente preparato, l'osservò corteggiato da quattro stelle, che gli s'aggirano intorno per orbi determinati e distinti, con regolati periodi ne' lor moti; e consecrandogli all'immortalità della Ser.ma Casa di V. A., gli diede nome di Stelle o Pianeti Medicei: e tutto questo scoperse in pochi giorni del mese di Gennaio del 1610 secondo lo stile romano, continuando tali osservazioni per tutto 'l Febbraio susseguente; quali tutte manifestò poi al mondo per mezzo del suo Nuncio Sidereo,		
A5807	diedero gran materia di discorsi a' filosofi et astronomi di que' tempi, molti de' quali su 'l principio ebbero gran repugnanza in prestargli fede, e molti temerariamente si sollevarono, altri con scritture private et altri più incauti sin con le stampe , stimando quelle vanità e delirii o finti avvisi del Sig.r Galileo, o pure false apparenze et illusioni de' cristalli; ma in breve gl'uni e gl'altri necessariamente cedettero alle confermazioni de' più savii, all'esperienze et al senso medesimo.		
A5809	all'esperienze et al senso medesimo.		
A5813	per prima assicurarsene con replicate osservazioni, e poter intanto formar concetto della essenza loro e con qualche probabilità almeno pronunciarne la sua oppinione.		
A5814	assicurarsene con replicate osservazioni		
A5817	nel Ser.mo D. Cosimo de' Medici non cedé punto a questa comune curiosità la sua regia munificenza, poi che volle con propria lettera de' 10 Luglio 1610 richiamarlo di Padova al suo servizio con titolo di Primario e Sopraordinario Matematico dello Studio di Pisa, senz'obligo di leggervi o risedervi, e di Primario Filosofo e Matematico della sua Ser.ma Altezza, assegnandogli a vita amplissimo stipendio, proporzionato alla somma generosità di un tanto Principe.		
A5819	Intorno alla fine di Marzo del 1611, desiderato il Sig.r Galileo et aspettato da tutta Roma, quivi si condusse, e nell'Aprile susseguente fece vedere i nuovi spettacoli del cielo a molti SS. Prelati e Cardinali, e particolarmente nel Giardino Quirinale, presente il Sig.r Card.le Bandini et i Mons.ri Dini, Corsini, Cavalcanti, Strozzi, Agucchia, et altri Signori, dimostrò le macchie solari:		
A5820	Avendo dunque egli solo veduto il primo nel cielo tante e così gran maraviglie, state occulte all'antichità, era ben dovere ch'egli in avvenire con nome di Linceo dovesse chiamarsi; onde allora fu quivi ascritto nella famosissima Accademia de' Lincei, poco avanti instituita dal Sig.r Principe Federigo Cesi, Marchese di Monticelli.		
A5822	In occasione delle dispute che nacquero in proposito del galleggiare, soleva dire il Sig.r Galileo, non vi esser più sottile né più industriosa maestra dell'ignoranza, poiché per mezzo di quella gl'era sortito di ritrovare molte ingegnose conclusioni e con nuove et esatte esperienze confermarle per satisfare all'ignoranza delli avversarii, alle quali per appagare il proprio intelletto non si sarebbe applicato.		
A5824	quivi fece scrupolosissime osservazioni intorno alle macchie solari:		
A5827	al conseguimento di ciò si richiedeva un'esatta cognizione de' periodi e moti di quelle stelle,		
A5828	quella non si poteva ottenere se non dal tempo, con moltissime e puntuali osservazioni:		
A5829	quantunque in meno di quindici mesi dal primo discoprimento de' Pianeti Medicei arrivasse ad investigare i lor movimenti con notabile aggiustatezza per le future predizioni, volle però con altre più esquisite osservazioni, e più distanti di tempo, emendargli.		
A5831	per facilitare i mezzi per condurla a buon fine, conferisse a S. Maestà un altro suo nuovo trovato, pur di grandissimo uso et acquisto nella navigazione, da S. A. stimatissimo e custodito con segretezza; et era l'invenzione d'un altro differente occhiale, col quale potevasi dalla cima dell'albero o del calcese d'una galera riconoscer da lontano la qualità, numero e forze de' vasselli nemici, assai prima dell'inimico medesimo, con egual prestezza e facilità che con l'occhio libero, guardandosi in un tempo stesso con amendue gl'occhi, e potendosi di più aver notizia della loro lontananza dalla propria galera, et in modo occultar lo strumento sì che altri non ne apprenda la fabbrica.		
A5842	Fu dalli Stati avidamente abbracciata sì generosa offerta, e nel progresso del trattato fu gradita con lor umanissima lettera, accompagnata con superba collana d'oro,		
A5843	della quale il Sig.r Galileo non volle per allora adornarsi, supplicando gli Stati a compiacersi che il lor regalo si trattenesse in altre mani sin che l'intrapreso negozio fosse ridotto a suo fine, per non dar materia a' maligni suoi emuli di spacciarlo come espilator de' tesori di gran Signori per mezzo di vane oblazioni e presuntuosi concetti.		
A5847	Poco dopo questa inaspettata pubblicazione, concedendomisi l'ingresso nella villa d'Arcetri, dove allor dimorava il sig.r Galileo, acciò quivi io potesse godere de' sapientissimi suoi colloquii e preziosi ammaestramenti, e contentandosi questi che nello studio delle matematiche, alle quali poco avanti mi ero applicato, io ricorresse alla viva sua voce per la soluzione di quei dubbii e difficoltà che per natural fiacchezza del mio ingegno bene spesso incontravo, accadde che nella lettura de' Dialogi sopradetti, arrivando al trattato de' moti locali, dubitai, come pur ad altri era occorso, non già della verità del principio sopra 'l quale è fondata l'intera scienza del moto accelerato, ma della necessità di supporlo come noto; onde io, ricercandolo di più evidenti confermazioni di quel supposto, fui cagione ch'egli nelle vigilie della notte, che allora con gran discapito della vita gli erano familiarissime, ne ritrovò la dimostrazione geometrica, dependente da dottrina da esso pur dimostrata contro ad una conclusione di Pappo (qual si vede nel suo trattato di Meccaniche, stampato dal suddetto P. Mersennio), et a me subito la conferì, sì come ad altri suoi amici ch'eran soliti visitarlo: et alcuni mesi dopo, compiacendosi di tenermi poi di continuo appresso la sua disciplina, per guidarmi, benché cieco come egli era di corpo, d'intelletto però lucidissimo, per il sentiero di quelli studii ch'egli intendeva ch'io proseguisse, imposemi ch'io facesse il disteso di quel teorema, per la difficoltà che gli arrecava la sua cecità nell'esplicarsi dove occorreva usar figure e caratteri; e di questo ne mandò più copie per l'Italia et in Francia alli amici suoi. Per una simil occasione di dubitare mi aveva ancora esplicato una sua considerazione o dimostrazione sopra la 5a e 7a definizione del quinto libro d'Euclide, dettandola a me dopo in dialogo per inserirla in detto suo libro appresso la prima proposizione del moto equabile, quando si fosse ristampato; et è quell'istessa dimostrazione che, a richiesta di V. A. S., fu poi distesa dal Sig.rEvangelista Torricelli, che l'aveva sentita dal medesimo Sig.r Galileo.		
A5851	ben diceva che le principali porte per introdursi nel ricchissimo erario della natural filosofia erano l'osservazioni e l'esperienze,		
A5853	Spese liberalmente in sollevar i depressi, in ricevere et onorare forestieri, in somministrar le comodità necessarie a poveri, eccellenti in qualch'arte o professione, mantenendogli in casa propria finché gli provvedesse di convenevol trattenimento.		
A5856	Fu nelle conversazioni universalmente amabilissimo, poiché discorrendo sul serio era ricchissimo di sentenze e concetti gravi, e ne' discorsi piacevoli l'arguzie et i sali non gli mancavano.		
A5857	Fu dotato dalla natura d'esquisita memoria; e gustando in estremo la poesia, aveva a mente, tra gl'autori latini, gran parte di Vergilio, d'Ovidio, Orazio e di Seneca, e tra i toscani quasi tutto 'l Petrarca, tutte le rime del Berni, e poco meno che tutto il poema di Lodovico Ariosto, che fu sempre il suo autor favorito e celebrato sopra gl'altri poeti, avendogli intorno fatte particolari osservazioni e paralleli col Tasso sopra moltissimi luoghi.		
A5858	Rinovò nella patria, e si può dire nell'Italia, le matematiche e la vera filosofia; e questo non solo con le pubbliche e private lezzioni nelle città di Pisa, Padova, Venezia, Roma e Firenze, ma ancora con le continue dispute che ne' congressi avanti di lui si facevano, instruendo particolarmente moltissimi curiosi ingegni e gran numero di gentiluomini, con lor notabili acquisti. Et in vero il Sig.r Galileo ebbe dalla natura così maravigliosa abilità d'erudire, che gli stessi scolari facevan in breve tempo conoscer la grandezza del loro maestro.		
A5859	con le continue dispute che ne' congressi avanti di lui si facevano, instruendo particolarmente moltissimi curiosi ingegni e gran numero di gentiluomini, con lor notabili acquisti.		
A5861	che se così fosse facile il far raccolta delle sue ingegnose risposte come si può dell'altrui proposte, certo è che si accumulerebbe un tesoro di inestimabil valore,

A5873	libera maniera di filosofare e discorrere		
A5874	e' ventiuno anni di sua età, con due anni soli di studio di geometria, inventò quello ch'in tal materia si vede scritto nell'Appendice impressa alla fine de' suoi Dialoghi delle due Nuove Scienze della meccanica e del moto locale		
A5875	urono da esso convinte di falsità, per mezzo d'esperienze e con salde dimostrazioni e discorsi, moltissime conclusioni dell'istesso Aristotele intorno alla materia del moto, sin a quel tempo state tenute per chiarissime et indubitabili		
A5877	d'esperienze e con salde dimostrazioni e discorsi,		
A5878	replicate esperienze

A5894	n gradimento di così nobil regalo fu immediatamente, con generosa dimostrazione della Ser.ma Republica, ne' 25 d'Agosto del 1609 ricondotto il Sig.r Galileo a vita sua alla medesima lettura, con più che triplicato stipendio del maggiore che fusse solito assegnarsi a' lettori di matematica.

A5904	l'osservò finalmente mutar figure come la luna, propalando quest'altra ammirabile novità tra gl'astronomi e matematici d'Europa		
A5905	dimostrò le macchie solari		
A5907	molte ingegnose conclusioni		
A5908	nuove et esatte esperienze confermarle per satisfare all'ignoranza delli avversarii		
A5910	et avendo ricevuto lettera dal Sig.r Marco Velsero, Duumviro d'Augusta, accompagnata con tre del suddetto Apelle sopra l'istesso argumento, ne i 4 di Maggio del 1612 rispose a quella con varie considerazioni sopra le lettere del medesimo Apelle, replicando ancora con altra de' 14 d'Agosto susseguente; e ricevendo dal Sig.r Velsero altre speculazioni e discorsi d'Apelle, scrisse la terza lettera del primo di Dicembre prossimo, sempre confermandosi con nuove e più accurate ragioni ne' suoi concetti: e di qui nacque l' Istoria e Demostrazioni delle Macchie Solari e loro accidenti, che nel 1613 fu publicata in Roma dall'Accademia de' Lincei insieme con le suddette lettere e disquisizioni del finto Apelle, dedicandola al medesimo Sig.r Filippo Salviati, nella villa del quale aveva il Sig.r Galileo osservato e scritto sopra queste apparenze; vedendosi in detta istoria ciò che di vero, o di probabile almeno, è stato detto fin ora sopra argumento così difficile e dubbio.		
A5911	Poi che il suddetto Matematico, offendendosi fuor del dovere e contro l'obligo di filosofo che le sue proposizioni non fossero ammesse senz'altro esame per infallibili e vere, o pure anche invidiando alla novità de' concetti così dottamente spiegati nel sopradetto Discorso delle Comete, indi a poco publicò una certa sua Libra astronomica e filosofica, mascherata con finto nome di Lotario Sarsio Sigensano, nella quale trattando con termini poco discreti il Sig.r Mario Guiducci e con molesti punture il Sig.r Galileo, necessitò questo a rispondere col suo Saggiatore, scritto in forma di lettera al Sig.r D. Virginio Cesarini, stampato in Roma nel 1623 dalli Accademici Lincei e dedicato al Sommo Pontefice Urbano Ottavo; per la qual opera chiaramente si scorge, quanto si deva alle persecuzioni delli emuli del Sig.r Galileo, ch'in certo modo sono stati autori di grandissimi acquisti in filosofia, destando in quello concetti altissimi e peregrine speculazioni, delle quali per altro saremmo forse restati privi.		
A5913	fu arrestato nel delizioso palazzo della Trinità de' Monti appresso l'ambasciador di Toscana, et in breve (essendogli dimostrato il suo errore) retrattò, come vero catolico, questa sua opinione		
A5914	in pena gli fu proibito il suo Dialogo		
A5915	ripigliando i suoi studii trovò e dimostrò gran parte delle conclusioni meccaniche sopra la materia delle resistenze de' solidi, con altre speculazioni		
A5917	n Germania fu tradotta e publicata in latino dal suddetto Mattia Berneggero, e da altri nelle lingue franzesi, inglesi e tedesche; et appresso fu stampato in Olanda, con la versione latina fatta da un tal Sig.r Elia Deodati, famosissimo iurisconsulto di Parigi e grandissimo litterato, un tal Discorso scritto già in volgare dal Sig.r Galileo circa l'anno 1615		
A5923	accadde che nella lettura de' Dialogi sopradetti, arrivando al trattato de' moti locali, dubitai, come pur ad altri era occorso, non già della verità del principio sopra 'l quale è fondata l'intera scienza del moto accelerato, ma della necessità di supporlo come noto; onde io, ricercandolo di più evidenti confermazioni di quel supposto, fui cagione ch'egli nelle vigilie della notte, che allora con gran discapito della vita gli erano familiarissime, ne ritrovò la dimostrazione geometrica, dependente da dottrina da esso pur dimostrata contro ad una conclusione di Pappo (qual si vede nel suo trattato di Meccaniche, stampato dal suddetto P.

A5929	Spese liberalmente in sollevar i depressi, in ricevere et onorare forestieri, in somministrar le comodità necessarie a poveri, eccellenti in qualch'arte o professione, mantenendogli in casa propria finché gli provvedesse di convenevol trattenimento		
A5933	indifferently resolved to assent unto that truth which upon deliberation shall seeme most probable unto thy reason,		
A5935	That thou shouldst not here looke to find any exact, accurate Treatise, since this discourse was but the fruit of some lighter studies, and those too hudled up in a short time, being first thought of and finished in the space of some few weekes, and therefore you cannot in reason expect, that it should be so polished, as perhaps, the subject would require, or the leisure of the Author might have done it.		
A5937	Many ancient Philosophers of the better note, have formerly defended this assertion, which I have here laid downe, and it were to be wished, that some of us would more apply our endeavours unto the examination of these old opinions, which though they have for a long time lien neglected by others, yet in them may you finde many truths wellworthy your paines and observation.		
A5939	It is my desire that by the occasion on this discourse, I may raise up some more active spirit to a search after other hidden and unknowne truthes.		
A5940	Since it must needes be a great impediment unto the growth of sciences, for men still so to plod on upon beaten principles, as to be afraid of entertaining any thing that may seeme to contradict them. An unwillingnesse to take such things into examination, is one of those errours of learning in these times observed by the judicious Verulam. Questionlesse there are many secret truths, which the ancients have passed over, that are yet left to make some of our age famous for their discovery.		
A5942	Here is an earnestnesse and hungering after novelty, which doth still adhere unto all our natures, and it is part of that primative image, that wide extent and infinite capacity at first created in the heart of man,		
A5948	It hath alwaies beene the unhappinesse of new truths in Philosophy, to be derided by those that are ignorant of the causes of things,		
A5951	I am resolved that this shall not be any discouragement, since I know that it is not the common opinion of others that can either adde or detract from the truth.		
A5954	hee shall see that the common opposition against this which I affirme cannot any way derogate from its truth.		
A5956	this great ignorance is not so much to be admired in him, as in those learneder men of later times, when all sciences began to flourish in the World.		
A5964	but whether this or what ever else was the meaning of this superstition, yet certainly 'twas a very ridiculous Stome, and bewrayed a great ignorance of those ancient times, especially since it was not onely received by the vulgar, such as were men of Iesse note and Iearning, but believed also, by the more famous and wiser sort		
A5966	plainly declare the insufficiency of common opinion to adde true worth or estimation unto any thing. So that from that which I have said may be gathered thus much.		
A5967	That a new truth may seeme absurd and impossible not onely to the vulgar, but to those also who are otherwise wise men, and excellent schollers; and hence it will follow, that every new thing which seemes to oppose common Principles is not presently to be rejected, but rather to be pry'd into with a diligent enquiry, since there are many things which are yet hid from us, and reserv'd for future discovery.		
A5976	I must needs confesse, though I had often thought with my selfe that it was possible there might be a world in the Moone, yet it seemed such an uncouth opinion that I never durst discover it, for feare of being counted singular and ridiculous, but afterward having read Plutarch, Galilæus, Keplar, with some others, and finding many of mine owne thoughts confirmed by such strong authority, I then concluded that it was not onely possible there might bee, but probable that there was another habitable world in that Planet.		
A5979	That a plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of reason or faith.		
A5982	he confirmes it by the strongest reasons that may be found,		
A5986	Aristotle himselfe was as loth to hold the possibility of a world which he could not discover, as Alexander was to heare of one which he could not conquer. Tis likely that some such by-respect moved him to this opinion, since the arguments he urges for it are confest by his zealous followers and commentators, to be very sleight and frivolous, and they themselves grant, what I am now to prove, that there is not any evidence in the light of naturall reason, which can sufficiently manifest that there is but one world.		
A5987	To it I answer, that this position in Philosophy, doth not bring any inconvenience to the rest, since tis not Aristotle, but truth that should be the rule of our opinions,		
A5988	Plato were his friend, yet hee would rather adhere to truth than him		
A5990	tis not ingratitude to speake against him, when hee opposeth truth;		
A6007	at least not thinke it to be as farre from truth, as it is from common opinion		
A6008	indifferently resolved to assent unto that truth which upon deliberation shall seeme most probable unto thy reason		
A6009	with an equall minde, not swayed by prejudice		
A6011	other hidden and unknowne truthes		
A6012	I may raise up some more active spirit to a search after other hidden and unknowne truthes		
A6015	that any truth doth now seeme distastefull for that very reason, for which errour is entertain'd		
A6019	new truths in Philosophy, to be derided by those that are ignorant of the causes of things, and reiected by others whose perversenesse ties them to the contrary opinion		
A6021	I know that it is not the common opinion of others that can either adde or detract from the truth		
A6022	Other truths have beene formerly esteemed altogether as ridiculous as this can be		
A6023	I may the better prepare the Reader to consider things without a prejudice		
A6024	the common opposition against this which I affirme cannot any way derogate from its truth		
A6025	Other truths have beene formerly accounted as ridiculous as this		
A6030	new truth		
A6033	hidden truths		
A6034	many more evident truths seeme incredible to such who know not the causes of things		
A6035	when a new, and an unheard of truth shall come before it, though it have good grounds and reasons, yet the understanding is afraid of it as a stranger, and dares not admit it into its beliefe without a great deale of reluctancy and tryall.		
A6037	such weake arguments could not convince that wise Philosopher, who in his other opinions was wont to bee swayed by the strength and power of reason		
A6039	tis not Aristotle, but truth that should be the rule of our opinions		
A6042	it is justly to be wondred why some should be so superstitious in these daies, as to sticke closer unto him, than unto Scripture, as if his Philosophy were the onely foundation of all divine truths		
A6045	a new truth		
A6050	the best of these hath not force enough to endanger the truth that I have delivered.		
A6055	Neither can this opinion derogate from the divine Wisdome (as Aquinas thinkes) but rather advance it, shewing a compendium of providence
