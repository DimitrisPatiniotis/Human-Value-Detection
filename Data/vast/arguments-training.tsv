B1	/	/	Once upon a time there was a rich man who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly
B2	/	/	Every morning he was the first one out of bed, and at night the last one to go to bed. Whenever there was a difficult job that nobody wanted to do, he was always the first to volunteer. He never complained at any of this, but was contented with everything and always happy
B4	/	/	The servant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had done before, and when at the end of this year he again received no wages, he still stayed on without complaining
B6	/	/	However, this time the servant said, Master, I have served you honestly for three years. Be so good as to give me what by rights I have coming to me. I would like to be on my way and see something else of the world.
B7	/	/	Yes, my good servant, answered the old miser, you have served me without complaint, and you shall be kindly rewarded.
B8	/	/	With this he put his hand into his pocket, then counted out three hellers one at a time, saying, There, you have a heller for each year. That is a large and generous reward. Only a few masters would pay you this much.
B12	/	/	How much is your treasure? the dwarf asked him. How much? Three hellers in real money, precisely counted.
B13	/	/	Now because the servant had a good heart and felt pity for the dwarf, he gave him his three hellers, saying, In God's name, I won't miss them.
B14	/	/	Then the dwarf said, Because I see that you have a good heart I will grant you three wishes, one for each heller. They shall all be fulfilled.
B19	/	/	As soon as he had thus refreshed himself a little, and caught his breath again, he ran into the town to the judge.
B20	/	/	Judge, sir, he said, Oh, woe is me! See how a godless man has robbed me and abused me on the open road. A stone on the ground would feel sorry for me. My clothes are ripped into shreds. My body is pricked and scratched to pieces. And what little I owned has been taken away with my purse -- genuine ducats, each piece more beautiful than the others. For God's sake, let the man be thrown into prison.
B24	/	/	As he was being led away, the Jew screamed after him, You good-for-nothing. You dog of a musician. Now you will receive your well earned reward.
B25	/	/	The servant walked quietly up the ladder with the hangman, but on the last rung he turned around and said to the judge, Grant me just one request before I die.
B27	/	/	I stole it. I stole it, he cried. But you have honestly earned it.
B30	/	/	Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife
B41	/	/	One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, when her little daughter came up too, and said, Mother, give me an apple. Yes, my child, said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest. The chest had a large heavy lid with a large sharp iron lock.
B42	/	/	Mother, said the little daughter, is brother not to have one too?
B47	/	/	Marlene went to her chest of drawers, took her best silk scarf from the bottom drawer, and gathered all the bones from beneath the table and tied them up in her silk scarf, then carried them outside the door, crying tears of blood.
B49	/	/	At the same time a mist seemed to rise from the tree, and in the center of this mist it burned like a fire, and a beautiful bird flew out of the fire singing magnificently, and it flew high into the air, and when it was gone, the juniper tree was just as it had been before, and the cloth with the bones was no longer there.
B50	/	/	My mother, she killed me, My father, he ate me, My sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
B52	/	/	My mother, she killed me, Then one of them stopped working. My father, he ate me, Then two more stopped working and listened, My sister Marlene, Then four more stopped, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf,
B53	/	/	Laid them beneath
B54	/	/	Yes, he said, if it belonged only to me, you should have it. Yes, said the others, if he sings again he can have it. Then the bird came down, and the twenty millers took a beam and lifted the stone up. Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho!
B55	/	/	He flew far away to a mill, and the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack.
B56	/	/	He flew far away to his father's house.
B61	/	/	With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully. Then the man went in and said, Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks.
B62	/	/	Then she was contented and happy. She put on the new red shoes and danced and leaped into the house. Oh, she said, I was so sad when I went out and now I am so contented. That is a splendid bird, he has given me a pair of red shoes.
B63	/	/	And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death. The father and Marlene heard it and went out. Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.
B64	/	/	Marlene, said the mother, what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it.
B66	/	/	Upon which so strange a spectacle, the people of the city gathered apace together upon the sands, to wonder; and so after put themselves into a number of small boats, to go nearer to this marvellous sight.
B67	/	/	and to discern (as far as appertaineth to the generations of men) between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures and illusions of all sorts.
B69	/	/	It is dedicated to the study of the works and creatures of God.

B102	/	/	Sapienza
B109	/	/	tra loro non possono donarsi cosa alcuna, perché tutto hanno del commune, e molto guardano gli offiziali, che nullo abbia più che merita. Però quanto è bisogno tutti l'hanno. E l'amico si conosce tra loro nelle guerre, nell'infirmità, nelle scienze, dove s'aiutano e s'insegnano l'un l'altro. E tutti li gioveni s'appellan frati e quei che son quindici anni più di loro, padri, e quindici meno figli. E poi vi stanno l'offiziali a tutte cose attenti, che nullo possa all'altro far torto nella fratellanza.
B111	/	/	bugia, che abborriscono più che la peste;
B112	/	/	non sendo tra loro latrocini, né assassinii, né stupri ed incesti, adultèri, delli quali noi ci accusamo
B113	/	/	Giustizia
B114	/	/	Verità
B115	/	/	di questi rei per pena son privati della mensa commune, o del commerzio delle donne, e d'alcuni onori, finché pare al giudice, per ammendarli.
B121	/	/	han potestà di battere o far battere da altri li negligenti e disobedienti,
B122	/	/	notano ognuno ed ognuna in che esercizio meglio riesce.
B125	/	/	Gli offiziali hanno la miglior parte; questi mandano spesso della loro a tavola a chi più si ha fatto onore la mattina nelle lezioni e dispute di scienze ed armi, e questo si stima per grande onore e favore.
B126	/	/	Hanno in tutte le piazze delli gironi le lor fontane, che tirano l'acque dal fondo solo con muover un legno, onde esse spicciano per li canali.
B127	/	/	Negli atri di fuora son orologi di sole e di squille per tutti i gironi, e banderuole per saper i venti.
B131	/	/	Il che non può avvenire al nostro Sole, perché non può arrivare a tante scienze chi non è scaltro d'ingegno ad ogni cosa, onde è sempre attivissimo al governo.
B132	/	/	Ma tutti questi offiziali han d'essere filosofi, e più, ed istorici, naturalisti ed umanisti.
B142	/	/	La superbia è tenuta per gran peccato, e si punisce un atto di superbia in quel modo che l'ha commesso.
B143	/	/	non tengono schiavi, perché essi bastano a se stessi, anzi soverchiano.
B154	/	/	Nell'assalti, chi prima saglie il muro ha dopo in onore una corona di gramigna con applauso militare delle donne e fanciulli. Chi aiuta il compagno ha la corona civica di quercia; chi uccide il tiranno, le spoglie opime, che porta al tempio, e si dona al Sole il cognome dell'impresa.
B155	/	/	Ci son poi li trionfi militari ad uso di Romani, e più belli, e le supplicazioni ringraziatorie. E si presenta al tempio il capitano, e si narrano li gesti dal poeta o istorico ch'andò con lui. E 'l Principe lo corona, ed a tutti soldati fa qualche regalo ed onore, e per molti dì sono esenti dalle fatiche publiche.
B157	/	/	Chi non aiutò l'amico o fe' atto vile, è frustato; chi fu disobediente, si mette a morire dentro a un palco di bestie con un bastone in mano, e se vince i leoni e l'orsi, che è quasi impossibile, torna in grazia.
B158	/	/	Perdonano volentieri a' nemici e dopo la vittoria li fanno bene. Se gettano mura o vogliono occider i capi o altro danno a' vinti, tutto fanno in un giorno, e poi li fanno bene, e dicono che non si deve far guerra se non per far gli uomini buoni, non per estinguerli.
B162	/	/	L'agricoltura è in gran stima: non ci è palmo di terra che non frutti. Osservano li venti e le stelle propizie, ed escono tutti in campo armati ad arare, seminare, zappare, metere, raccogliere, vindemmiare, con musiche, trombe e stendardi; ed ogni cosa fanno tra pochissime ore. Hanno le carra a vela, che caminano con il vento, e quando non ci è vento, una bestia tira un gran carro, bella cosa, ed han li guardiani del territorio armati, che per li campi sempre van girando. Poco usano letame all'orti ed a' campi, dicendo che li semi diventano putridi e fan vita breve, come le donne imbellettate e non belle per esercizio fanno prole fiacca. Onde né pur la terra imbellettano, ma ben l'esercitano, ed hanno gran secreti di far nascer presto e multiplicare, e non perder seme. E tengon un libro a posta di tal esercizio, che si chiama la Georgica. Una parte del territorio, quanto basta, si ara; l'altra serve per pascolo delle bestie. Or questa nobil arte di far cavalli, bovi, pecore, cani ed ogni sorte d'animali domestici è in sommo pregio appresso loro, come fu in tempo antico d'Abramo; e con modi magici li fanno venire al coito, che possan ben generare, inanzi a cavalli pinti o bovi o pecore; e non lasciano andar in campagna li stalloni con le giumente, ma li donano a tempo opportuno inanzi alle stalle di campagna. Osservano Sagittario in ascendente, con buono aspetto di Marte e Giove: per li bovi, Tauro, per le pecore, Ariete, secondo l'arte. Hanno poi mandre di galline sotto le Pleiadi e papare e anatre, guidate a pascere dalle donne con gusto loro presso alla città e li luochi, dove la sera son serrate a far il cascio e latticini, butiri e simili. Molto attendono a' caponi ed a' castrati ed al frutto, e ci è un libro di quest'arte detto la Bucolica.
B166	/	/	navigano per conoscer genti e paesi.
B167	/	/	Dicono che il mondo averà da riducersi a vivere come essi fanno, però cercano sempre sapere se altri vivono meglio di loro.
B168	/	/	Hanno anche gran secreti di fuochi artifiziali per le guerre marine e terrestri, e stratagemme, che mai non restan di vincere.
B170	/	/	Segno d'ingegno grande,
B175	/	/	quando occorre caso ingiurioso, l'omicidio si punisce con morte, ed occhio per occhio, naso per naso si paga la pena della pariglia,
B176	/	/	s'appella pure al Metafisico per grazia, non per giustizia, e quello può far la grazia.
B181	/	/	tutti gli offiziali son sacerdoti, parlando delli capi, ed offizio loro è purgar le conscienze.
B182	/	/	Talché tutti si confessano a quelli, ed essi imparano che sorti di peccati regnano.
B188	/	/	Ma chi dice bugia in laude è punito; non si può dir poeta chi finge menzogna tra loro; e questa licenza dicono che è ruina del mondo, che toglie il premio alle virtù e lo dona altrui per paura o adulazione.
B191	/	/	Però essi cercano assai sottilmente questo negozio, perché importa a saper la fabbrica del mondo, e se perirà e quando, e la sostanza delle stelle e chi ci sta dentro a loro.
B196	/	/	Stanno anche molto curiosi
B202	/	/	Quel che non vuoi per te non far ad altri, e quel che vuoi per te fa' tu il medesimo.
B204	/	/	Oh, se sapessi che cosa dicono per astrologia e per l'istessi profeti nostri ed ebrei e d'altre genti di questo secolo nostro, c'ha più storia in cento anni che non ebbe il mondo in quattro mila; e più libri si fecero in questi cento che in cinque mila: e dell'invenzioni stupende della calamita e stampe ed archibugi, gran segni dell'union del mondo; e come, stando nella triplicità quarta l'asside di Mercurio a tempo che le congiunzioni magne si faceano in Cancro, fece queste cose inventare per la Luna e Marte, che in quel segno valeno al navigar novo, novi regni e nove armi. Ma entrando l'asside di Saturno in Capricorno, e di Mercurio in Sagittario, e di Marte in Vergine, e le congiunzioni magne tornando alla triplicità prima dopo l'apparizion della stella nova in Cassiopea, sarà grande monarchia nova, e di leggi riforma e d'arti, e profeti e rinovazione. E dicono che a' cristiani questo apporterà grand'utile; ma prima si svelle e monda, poi s'edifica e pianta.
B205	/	/	Questo sappi, c'han trovato l'arte del volare, che sola manca al mondo, ed aspettano un occhiale di veder le stelle occulte ed un oricchiale d'udir l'armonia delli moti di pianeti.
B208	/	/	Questo si sappi, che essi tengon la libertà dell'arbitrio.
B209	/	/	chi segue più il senso che la ragione è soggetto a loro.
B210	/	/	le stelle nelli sensuali inchinano a quella, nelli razionali alla vera legge santa della prima Raggione, sempre laudanda.
B211	/	/	Dimmi, di grazia, tutto quello che t'avvenne in questa navigazione.
B215	/	/	E' la città distinta in sette gironi grandissimi, nominati dalli sette pianeti, e s'entra dall'uno all'altro per quattro strade e per quattro porte, alli quattro angoli del mondo spettanti;
B216	/	/	la porta Tramontana, di ferro coperta, fatta che s'alza e cala con bello ingegno,
B217	/	/	stupendo artifizio.
B218	/	/	Sopra l'altare non vi è altro ch'un mappamondo assai grande, dove tutto il cielo è dipinto, ed un altro dove è la terra. Poi sul cielo della cupola vi stanno tutte le stelle maggiori del cielo, notati coi nomi loro e virtù, c'hanno sopra le cose terrene, con tre versi per una; ci sono i poli e i circoli signati non del tutto, perché manca il muro a basso, ma si vedono finiti in corrispondenza alli globbi dell'altare. Vi sono sempre accese sette lampade nominate dalli sette pianeti.
B220	/	/	Il Metafisico tratta tutti questi negozi con loro, ché senza lui nulla si fa, ed ogni cosa la communicano essi quattro, e dove il Metafisico inchina, son d'accordo.
B223	/	/	Tutte cose son communi; ma stan in man di offiziali le dispense, onde non solo il vitto, ma le scienze e onori e spassi son communi, ma in maniera che non si può appropriare cosa alcuna.
B224	/	/	Dunque nullo vorrà fatigare, mentre aspetta che l'altro fatighi,
B226	/	/	li fanciulli imparano la lingua e l'alfabeto nelle mura,
B227	/	/	Dopo li sette anni vanno alle lezioni delle scienze naturali, tutti;
B228	/	/	Poi tutti si mettono alle matematiche, medicine ed altre scienze,
B229	/	/	Ed in campagna, nei lavori e nella pastura delle bestie pur vanno a imparare; e quello è tenuto di più gran nobiltà, che più arti impara, e meglio le fa.
B233	/	/	Si dona a ciascuno, secondo il suo esercizio, piatto di pitanza e menestra, frutti, cascio;
B237	/	/	Se si trovano in sodomia, sono vituperati, e li fan portare due giorni legata al collo una scarpa, significando che pervertiro l'ordine e posero li piedi in testa, e la seconda volta crescen la pena finché diventa capitale.
B238	/	/	Ma chi si astiene fin a ventun anno d'ogni coito è celebrato con alcuni onori e canzoni.
B244	/	/	Onde agli eroi ed eroisse la republica fa certi doni, in tavola o in feste publiche, di ghirlande o di vestimenta belle fregiate;
B249	/	/	ricchi, ch'ogni cosa hanno e possedono;
B251	/	/	vanno spiando di tutte nazioni l'usanze, e sempre migliorano;
B255	/	/	talché manca il servizio publico, e non si può il campo, la milizia e l'arti fare, se non male e con stento.
B258	/	/	ed ognuno piglia parte della pena.
B264	/	/	Se tra loro ci è qualche gara d'ingiuria o d'altro, perché essi non contendono se non di onore, il Principe ed i suoi offiziali puniscono il reo secretamente, s'incorse ad ingiuria di fatto dopo le prime ire; se di parole, aspettano in guerra a diffinirle, dicendo che l'ira si deve sfogare contra l'inimici.
B266	/	/	E se sono in campo aperto, serrano le bagaglie in mezzo e l'artellerie, e combattono gran pezzo, e poi fan ritirata. E 'l nemico, credendo che cedano, s'inganna; perché essi fanno ala, pigliano fiato e lasciano l'artiglierie sparare, e poi tornano alla zuffa contra nemici scompigliati.

B325	/	/	The Lady now finding her self in so strange a place, and amongst such wonderful kind of Creatures, was extreamly strucken with fear, and could entertain no other Thoughts, but that every moment her life was to be a sacrifice to their cruelty; but those Bear-like Creatures, how terrible soever they appear'd to her sight, yet were they so far from exercising any cruelty upon her, that rather they shewed her all civility and kindness imaginable;
B328	/	/	Very good Navigators they were; and though they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile observations, and great practice;
B334	/	/	Of the States men she enquired, first, Why they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last brake out into open Wars.
B345	/	/	This observation amazed the Empress very much; for she had hitherto believed, That Snow was made by cold motions, and not by such an agitation or beating of a fiery extract upon water: Nor could she be perswaded to believe it until the Fish- or Mear-men had delivered their observation upon the making of Ice,
B346	/	/	This Relation confirmed partly the observation of the Bird-men concerning the cause of Snow;
B347	/	/	to avoid hereafter tedious disputes, and have the truth of the Phænomena's of Cœlestial Bodies more exactly known, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers, to observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which they did according to her Majesties Command;
B350	/	/	the Empress began to grow angry at their Telescopes, that they could give no better Intelligence; for, said she, now I do plainly perceive, that your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses; Wherefore I Command you to break them, and let the Bird-men trust onely to their natural eyes, and examine Cœlestial Objects by the motions of their own Sense and Reason.
B351	/	/	if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth;
B352	/	/	if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth; Wherefore I command you again to break them; for you may observe the progressive motions of Cœlestial Bodies with your natural eyes better then through Artificial Glasses.
B353	/	/	for, said they, we take more delight in Artificial delusions, then in Natural truths. Besides, we shall want Imployments for our Senses, and Subjects for Arguments; for, were there nothing but truth, and no falshood, there would be no occasion to dispute, and by this means we should want the aim and pleasure of our endeavors in confuting and contradicting each other; neither would one man be thought wiser then another, but all would either be alike knowing and wise, or all would be fools;
B357	/	/	this was very remarkable and worthy to be taken notice of, that notwithstanding their great skil, industry and ingenuity in Experimental Philosophy, they could yet by no means contrive such Glasses, by the help of which they could spy out a Vacuum, with all its dimensions, nor Immaterial substances, Non-beings, and Mixt-beings, or such as are between something and nothing; which they were very much troubled at, hoping that yet, in time, by long study and practice, they might perhaps attain to it.
B359	/	/	Truly, answered they, Your Majesty puts a very hard question to us, and we shall hardly be able to give a satisfactory answer to it; for there are many different sorts of Creatures, which as they have all different perceptions, so they have also different organs, which our senses are not able to discover, onely in an Oystershell we have with admiration observed, that the common sensorium of the Oyster lies just as the closing of the shells, where the pressure and re-action may be perceived by the opening and shutting of the shells every tide.
B360	/	/	This Relation confirmed the Empress in the opinion concerning the motion of the Earth, and the fixedness of the Sun, as the Bird-men had informed her;
B362	/	/	the Worm-men excused themselves, that they were ignorant in that Art, and that such questions belonged more properly to the Ape-men, which were Her Majesties Chymists.
B365	/	/	After this, and several other Conferences, which the Empress held with the Worm-men, she dismissed them; and having taken much satisfaction in several of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and Observations.
B369	/	/	if this be so, as surely, according to regular Sense and Reason, it appears no otherwise; it is in vain to look for primary Ingredients, or constitutive principles of Natural Bodies, since there is no more but one Universal Principle of Nature,
B371	/	/	The Empress having thus declared her mind to the Ape-men, and given them better Instructions then perhaps they expected, not knowing that her Majesty had such great and able judgment in Natural Philosophy, had several conferences with them concerning Chymical Preperations,
B372	/	/	she knew that Nature's Works are so various and wonderful, that no particular Creature is able to trace her ways.
B375	/	/	Then came the Lice-men, and endeavoured to measure all things to a hairs-breadth, and weigh them to an Atom; but their weights would seldom agree, especially in the weighing of Air, which they found a task impossible to be done; at which the Empress began to be displeased, and told them, that there was neither Truth nor Justice in their Profession; and so dissolved their society.
B377	/	/	I have enough, said she, of your chopt Logick, and will hear no more of your Syllogisms; for it disorders my Reason, and puts my Brain on the rack; your formal argumentations are able to spoil all natural wit; and I'le have you to consider, that Art does not make Reason, but Reason makes Art; and therefore as much as Reason is above Art, so much is a natural rational discourse to be preferred before an artificial:
B378	/	/	your Art of Logick, which consists onely in contradicting each other, in making sophismes, and obscuring Truth, instead of clearing it.
B388	/	/	she asked again, Whether our Fore-fathers had been as wise, as Men were at present, and had understood sense and reason, as well as they did now? They answered, That in former Ages they had been as wise as they are in this present, nay, wiser; for, said they, many in this age do think their Fore-fathers have been Fools, by which they prove themselves to be such.
B391	/	/	It is the nature of Mankind to be inquisitive. Natural desire of knowledg,
B395	/	/	The Duchess told her, That, Sense and Reason would instruct her of a Nature as much as could be known; and as for Numbers, they were infinite; but to add non-sense to infinite, would breed a confusion, especially in Humane Understanding.
B396	/	/	The Duchess answered, That the chief and onely ground in Government, was but Reward and Punishment, and required no further Cabbala;
B398	/	/	At last, when the Duchess saw that no patterns would do her any good in the framing of her World; she was resolved to make a World of her own Invention, and this World was composed of sensitive and rational self-moving Matter; indeed, it was composed onely of the Rational, which is the subtilest and purest degree of Matter; for as the Sensitive did move and act both to the perceptions and consistency of the body, so this degree of Matter at the same point of time (for though the degrees are mixt, yet the several parts may move several ways at one time) did move to the Creation of the Imaginary World;
B400	/	/	it was governed without secret and deceiving Policy; neither was there any ambitious, factions, malicious detractions, civil dissentions, or home-bred quarrels, divisions in Religion, Foreign Wars, &c. but all the people lived in a peaceful society, united Tranquility, and Religious Conformity.
B404	/	/	Many, both of your modern and ancient Philosophers, answered the Spirits, endeavour to go beyond Sense and Reason, which makes them commit absurdities; for no corporeal Creature can go beyond Sense and Reason;
B413	/	/	Beautiful Truth, Great Fortune, and you the rest of my noble Friends; I am come a great and long journey in the behalf of my dear Friend the Duke of Newcastle; not to make more wounds, but, if it be possible, to heal those that are made already. Neither do I presume to be a Deity; but my onely request is, that you would be pleased to accept of my Offering, I being an humble and devout supplicant; and since no offering is more acceptable to the Gods, then the offering of Peace; in order to that, I desire to make an agreement between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle.
B414	/	/	I came not here, said she, to hear Fortune flattered, but to hear the Cause decided between Fortune and the Duke; neither came I hither to speak Rhetorically and Eloquently, but to propound the case plainly and truly;
B417	/	/	he could not trust Fortune with that which he preferred above his life, which was his Reputation, by reason Fortune did not side with those that were honest and honourable, but renounced them; and since he could not be of both sides, he chose to be of that which was agreeable both to his Conscience, Nature and Education;
B423	/	/	One time the Duchess chanced to discourse with some of her acquaintance, of the Empress of the Blazing-World, who asked her what Pastimes and Recreations her Majesty did most delight in? The Duchess answered, That she spent most of her time in the study of Natural Causes and Effects, which was her chief delight and pastime; and that she loved to discourse sometimes with the most Learned persons of that World:
B424	/	/	she loved to discourse sometimes with the most Learned persons of that World:
B426	/	/	I have made my Blazing-World a Peaceable World,
B427	/	/	But I esteeming Peace before Warr, Wit before Policy, Honesty before Beauty; instead of the figures of Alexander, Cesar, Hector, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses, Hellen, &c. chose rather the figure of Honest Margaret Newcastle, which now I would not change for all this Terrestrial World; and if any should like the World I have made, and be willing to be my Subjects, they may imagine themselves such, and they are such, I mean in their Minds, Fancies or Imaginations; but if they cannot endure to be Subjects, they may create Worlds of their own, and Govern themselves as they please. But yet let them have a care, not to prove unjust Usurpers, and to rob me of mine: for, concerning the Philosophical-world, I am Empress of it my self; and as for the Blazing-World, it having an Empress already, who rules it with great Wisdom and Conduct, which Empress is my dear Platonick Friend; I shall never prove so unjust, treacherous and unworthy to her, as to disturb her Government, much less to depose her from her Imperial Throne, for the sake of any other, but rather chuse to create another World for another Friend.

B433	/	/	though they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile observations, and great practice; in so much that they could not onely tell the depth of the Sea in every place, but where there were shelves of Sand, Rocks, and other obstructions to be avoided by skilful and experienced Sea-men
B434	/	/	they had an extraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers, and that was a certain Engin, which would draw in a great quantity of Air, and shoot forth Wind with a great force; this Engine in a calm, they placed behind their Ships, and in a storm, before; for it served against the raging waves, like Cannons against an hostile Army, or besieged Town

B436	/	/	Novelty discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in peace and tranquillity
B438	/	/	No sooner was the Lady brought before the Emperor, but he conceived her to be some Goddess, and offered to worship her; which she refused, telling him, (for by that time she had pretty well learned their Language) that although she came out of another world, yet was she but a mortal
B439	/	/	At which the Emperor rejoycing, made her his Wife, and gave her an absolute power to rule and govern all that World as she pleased
B440	/	/	the Empress encouraged them in, especially those that had applied themselves to the study of several Arts and Sciences; for they were as ingenious and witty in the invention of profitable and useful Arts, as we are in our world, nay, more
B441	/	/	Why they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last brake out into open Wars.
B442	/	/	to avoid hereafter tedious disputes, and have the truth of the Phænomena's of Cœlestial Bodies more exactly known, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers, to observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which they did according to her Majesties Command
B443	/	/	your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses
B444	/	/	Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth
B447	/	/	as Experience doth sufficiently witness
B448	/	/	But since you have informed me, said she, of the various sorts and productions of Animal Creatures, I desire you to tell me what you have observed of their sensitive perceptions?
B449	/	/	we shall hardly be able to give a satisfactory answer to it
B450	/	/	After all this, the Empress desired the Worm men to give her a true Relation how frost was made upon the Earth?
B451	/	/	they gave, according to their Observation, this following reason
B452	/	/	This Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chymists, the Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a temperate degree of hea
B453	/	/	This Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chymists, the Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a temperate degree of heat.
B454	/	/	having taken much satisfaction in several of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and Observations
B455	/	/	commanded them to give her an account of the several Transmutations which their Art was able to produce.
B457	/	/	The Conferences of the Chymists being finished, the Empress made an Assembly of her Galenical Physicians, her Herbalists and Anatomists; and first she enquired of her Herbalists the particular effects of several Herbs and Drugs, and whence they proceeded?
B458	/	/	for by dissecting some, we cannot prevent the production of others; so that our pains and labour will be to no purpose, unless to satisfie the vain curiosities of inquisitive men. The Empress replied, That such dissections would be very beneficial to Experimental Philosophers
B459	/	/	such dissections would be very beneficial to Experimental Philosophers
B460	/	/	hen we dissect dead Animals, said they, it is for no other end, but to observe what defects and distempers they had, that we may cure the like in living ones, so that all our care and industry concerns onely the preservation of Mank
B461	/	/	as for Improbable Truth I know not what your meaning is; for Truth is more then Improbability: nay, there is so much difference between Truth and Improbability, that I cannot conceive it possible how they can be joined together

B465	/	/	she desired to know
B466	/	/	I pray inform me
B467	/	/	the Empress desired to be informed
B468	/	/	she desired to be informed
B469	/	/	Let me now desire you to inform me

B550	/	/	let us permit these new hypotheses also to become known, especially since they are admirable as well as simple and bring with them a huge treasure of very skillful observations.
B554	/	/	I am aware that a philosopher’s ideas are not subject to the judgement of ordinary persons, because it is his endeavor to seek the truth in all things, to the extent permitted to human reason by God.

B571	/	/	false,
B573	/	/	I was impelled to consider a different system of deducing the motions of the universe’s spheres for no other reason than the realization that astronomers do not agree among themselves in their investigations of this subject. For, in the first place, they are so uncertain about the motion of the sun and moon that they cannot establish and observe a constant length even for the tropical year. Secondly, in determining the motions not only of these bodies but also of the other five planets, they do not use the same principles, assumptions, and explanations of the apparent revolutions and motions.
B574	/	/	by this means they were unable to obtain any incontrovertible result in absolute agreement with the phenomena.
B579	/	/	understood with greater certainty
B580	/	/	I undertook the task of rereading the works of all the philosophers which I could obtain to learn whether anyone had ever proposed other motions of the universe’s spheres than those expounded by the teachers of astronomy in the schools.

B615	/	/	disagreement,
B616	/	/	knowledge
B620	/	/	An additional reason is that the motion of the planets and the revolution of the stars could not be measured with numerical precision and completely understood except with the passage of time and the aid of many earlier observations, through which this knowledge was transmitted to posterity from hand to hand, so to say.
B622	/	/	the motion of the heavenly bodies has eluded the skill of the astronomers.
B624	/	/	The philosopher will perhaps rather seek the semblance of the truth
B626	/	/	Therefore with the utmost earnestness I entreat you, most learned sir, unless I inconvenience you, to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars, and at the earliest possible moment to send me your writings on the sphere of the universe together with the tables and whatever else you have that is relevant to this subject.
B627	/	/	I must be immediately repudiated together with this belief
B628	/	/	For I am not so enamored of my own opinions that I disregard what others may think of them
B631	/	/	But while I hesitated for a long time and even resisted, my friends drew me back
B633	/	/	not false
B635	/	/	For this reason I undertook the task of rereading the works of all the philosophers which I could obtain to learn whether anyone had ever proposed other motions of the universe’s spheres than those expounded by the teachers of astronomy in the schools
B637	/	/	I do not run away from the judgement of anybody at all,
B638	/	/	I have no doubt that acute and learned astronomers will agree with me if, as this discipline especially requires, they are willing to examine and consider, not superficially but thoroughly, what I adduce in this volume in proof of these matters

B679	/	/	Je m'en allais, dès qu'elle était levée, rêvant, parmi les bois, à la conduite et à la réussite de mon entreprise;
B680	/	/	J'avais fait une machine que je m'imaginais capable de m'élever autant que je voudrais, en sorte que, rien de tout ce que j'y croyais nécessaire n'y manquant, je m'assis dedans, et me précipitai en l'air, du haut d'une roche.

Après la bataille donnée, on compte les blessés, les morts, les prisonniers; car, pour les fuyards, il ne s'en trouve point; si les pertes se trouvent égales de part et d'autre, ils tirent à la courte paille à qui se proclamera victorieux.

Cependant, avec toute l'égalité que vous recommandez, tant à vos gladiateurs, ils ne se battent jamais pareils; car l'un sera de grande, l'autre, de petite taille; l'un sera adroit, l'autre n'aura jamais manié d'épée; l'un sera robuste, l'autre faible; et, quand même ces disproportions seraient égales, qu'ils seraient aussi adroits et aussi forts l'un que l'autre, encore ne seraient-ils pas pareils, car l'un des deux aura peut-être plus de courage que l'autre; et, sous l'ombre que cet emporté ne considérera pas le péril, qu'il sera bilieux, qu'il aura plus de sang, qu'il avait le cœur plus serré, avec toutes ces qualités qui font le courage, comme si ce n'était pas, aussi bien qu'une épée, une arme que son ennemi n'a point, il s'ingère de se ruer éperdument sur lui, de l'effrayer, et d'ôter la vie à ce pauvre homme, qui prévoit le danger, dont la chaleur est étouffée dans la pituite, et duquel le cœur est trop vaste pour unir les esprits nécessaires à dissiper cette glace qu'on appelle _poltronnerie_.

B809	/	/	En vérité, Messieurs, si vous rencontriez un homme d'âge mûr, qui veillât à la police d'une fourmilière, pour tantôt donner un soufflet à la fourmi qui aurait fait choir sa compagne, tantôt en emprisonner une qui aurait dérobé à sa voisine un grain de blé, tantôt mettre en justice une autre qui aurait abandonné ses œufs, ne l'estimeriez-vous pas insensé de vaquer à des choses trop au-dessous de lui, et de prétendre assujettir à la raison des animaux qui n'en ont pas l'usage? Comment donc, vénérable assemblée, défendrez-vous l'intérêt que vous prenez aux caprices de ce petit animal? Justes, j'ai dit.»

B827	/	/	Je ne suis pas si surpris, répliquai-je, qu'il s'abstienne de la chair, et de toutes choses qui ont eu vie sensitive; car, en notre Monde, les Pythagoriciens, et même quelques saints anachorètes, ont usé de ce régime; mais de n'oser, par exemple, couper un chou, de peur de le blesser, cela me semble tout à fait ridicule.  --Et moi, répondit mon Démon, je trouve beaucoup d'apparence en son opinion. Car, dites-moi, ce chou dont vous parlez n'est-il pas comme vous un être existant de la Nature?
B828	/	/	Si on dit que nous sommes faits à l'image du premier Etre, et non pas le chou? Quand il serait vrai, nous avons, en souillant notre âme, par où nous lui ressemblons, effacé cette ressemblance, puisqu'il n'y a rien de plus contraire à Dieu que le péché.
B829	/	/	Le péché de massacrer un homme n'est pas si grand, parce qu'un jour il revivra, que de couper un chou et lui ôter la vie, à lui qui n'en a point d'autre à espérer.
B830	/	/	Il est vrai que nous naquîmes les premiers; mais, dans la famille de Dieu, il n'y a point de droit d'aînesse:
B831	/	/	si donc les choux n'eurent point de part avec nous du fief de l'immortalité, ils furent sans doute avantagés de quelque autre qui, par sa grandeur, récompensât sa brièveté; c'est peut-être un intellect universel, une connaissance parfaite de toutes les choses dans leurs causes;
B832	/	/	Souvenez-vous donc, ô de tous les animaux le plus superbe! qu'encore qu'un chou que vous coupez ne dise mot, il n'en pense pas moins.
B833	/	/	le pauvre végétant n'a pas des organes propres à hurler comme vous; il n'en a pas pour frétiller ni pour pleurer; il en a toutefois, par lesquels il se plaint du tort que vous lui faites, et par lesquels il attire sur vous la vengeance du Ciel.
B834	/	/	il en a toutefois, par lesquels il se plaint du tort que vous lui faites, et par lesquels il attire sur vous la vengeance du Ciel.
B838	/	/	Lorsqu'elle fut apportée, il la saisit par le bras, et la fouetta un gros quart d'heure.  --Or sus! vaurien, continua-t-il, en punition de votre désobéissance, je veux que vous serviez aujourd'hui de risée à tout le monde, et, pour cet effet, je vous commande de ne marcher que sur deux pieds le reste de la journée.
B839	/	/	les mobiles, comme par exemple celle où nous sommes maintenant, sont faites comme je vais vous dire. L'architecte construit chaque Palais, ainsi que vous voyez, d'un bois fort léger; il pratique dessous quatre roues; dans l'épaisseur de l'un des murs, il place dix gros soufflets, dont les tuyaux passent, d'une ligne horizontale, à travers le dernier étage, de l'un à l'autre pignon, en sorte que, quand on veut traîner les Villes autre part (car on les change d'air à toutes les saisons), chacun déplie sur l'un des côtés de son logis quantité de larges voiles au-devant des soufflets; puis, ayant bandé un ressort pour les faire jouer, leurs maisons, en moins de huit jours, avec les bouffées continuelles que vomissent ces monstres à vent, sont emportées, si on veut, à plus de cent lieues.
B841	/	/	Ainsi, je lui ai promis d'aider son dessein de toutes mes forces, et d'inventer, pour cet effet, une machine capable de tenir trois ou quatre personnes, dans laquelle vous pourrez monter ensemble dès aujourd'hui
B842	/	/	Je vais m'appliquer sérieusement à l'exécution de cette entreprise:
B846	/	/	Maintenant, afin que vous sachiez pourquoi en ce pays tout le monde a le nez grand, apprenez qu'aussitôt que la femme est accouchée, la matrone porte l'enfant au maître du Séminaire; et justement, au bout de l'an, les experts étant assemblés, si son nez est trouvé plus court qu'à une certaine mesure que tient le Syndic, il est censé camus et mis entre les mains de gens qui le châtrent. Vous me demanderez la cause de cette barbarie, et comment il peut se faire que nous, chez qui la virginité est un crime, établissons des continences par force? Mais sachez que nous le faisons après avoir observé, depuis trente siècles, qu'un grand nez est le signe d'un homme spirituel, courtois, affable, généreux, libéral; et que le petit est un signe du contraire. C'est pourquoi des Camus on bâtit les Eunuques, parce que la République aime mieux ne pas avoir d'enfants que d'en avoir qui leur fussent semblables.
B848	/	/	O mon petit homme! s'écria-t-il, quoi! les grands de votre Monde sont si enragés de faire parade d'un grand instrument qui désigne un bourreau, qui n'est forgé que pour nous détruire, enfin l'ennemi juré de tout ce qui vit;
B851	/	/	Il s'en alla ensuite et me laissa dans l'admiration des gens de ce Monde-là, dans lesquels, jusqu'au simple peuple, il se trouve naturellement tant d'esprit, au lieu que ceux du nôtre en ont si peu, et qui leur coûte si cher.
B853	/	/	_Pour me purger de ce mauvais air, je m'exposais tout nu au soleil dessus une terrasse,
B856	/	/	Mais j'eus beau leur alléguer que _Pythagore_, _Epicure_, _Démocrite et de notre âge Copernic et Keppler_[4] avaient été de cette opinion
B858	/	/	J'avais attaché autour de moi quantité de fioles pleines de rosée, sur lesquelles le Soleil dardait ses rayons si violemment, que la chaleur, qui les attirait, comme elle fait les plus grosses nuées, m'éleva si haut, qu'enfin je me trouvai au-dessus de la moyenne région

B877	/	/	J'ai souvent fait depuis réflexion sur ce que le vulgaire assure qu'en se précipitant d'un lieu fort haut, on est étouffé avant de toucher la terre; et j'ai conclu, de mon aventure, qu'il en avait menti

B943	/	/	Il y avoit longtemps que nous ne parlions plus des mondes, Madame L.M.D.G. et moi,
B944	/	/	j’allai un jour chez elle, et y entrai justement comme deux hommes d’esprit
B947	/	/	moi, avec toute la naïveté possible, je lui ai soutenu que je le croyois
B949	/	/	il a toujours pris cela pour une feinte d’une personne qui vouloit se divertir, et j’ai cru que ce qui le rendoit si opiniâtre à ne me pas croire moi même sur mes sentimens, c’est qu’il m’estimoit trop pour s’imaginer que je fusse capable d’une opinion si extravagante.
B950	/	/	il m’estimoit trop pour s’imaginer que je fusse capable d’une opinion si extravagante.
B955	/	/	Ils ont bien de l’esprit, répliquai-je, mais ils ne raisonnent jamais.
B956	/	/	Les raisonneurs, qui sont gens durs, les appelleront peuple sans difficulté.
B959	/	/	Trahir la vérité ! dit la Marquise. Vous n’avez point de conscience.
B962	/	/	La raison a beau venir nous dire qu’il y a dans les planètes des campagnes, des prairies, la raison vient trop tard,
B963	/	/	le premier coup d’œil a fait son effet sur nous avant elle,
B965	/	/	Voudriez-vous que pour établir les habitants des planètes, dont les intérêts me touchent d’assez loin, j’allasse attaquer ces redoutables puissances qu’on appelle les sens et l’imagination ?
B970	/	/	vous ne sauriez imaginer le moindre sujet de doute, si vous ne reprenez les yeux et l’esprit du peuple.
B974	/	/	Les horloges les plus communes et les plus grossières marquent les heures, il n’y a que celles qui sont travaillées avec plus d’art qui marquent les minutes.
B979	/	/	Mais qu’ils aient réellement cette révolution de vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre, c’est bien la chose du monde où il y a le moins d’apparence, quoique l’absurdité n’en saute pas d’abord aux yeux.
B981	/	/	Je vous entends, interrompit la Marquise, et je crois que vous avez raison. Oui, je suis de votre avis ; si les planètes tournoient autour de la Terre, elles tourneroient en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances, ainsi qu’elles font autour du Soleil ; n’est-ce pas ce que vous voulez dire ?
B983	/	/	et les étoiles fixes, qui sont si prodigieusement éloignées de nous, si fort élevées au-dessus de tout ce qui pourroit prendre autour de nous un mouvement général, du moins situées en lieu où ce mouvement devroit être fort affaibli, n’y aurait-il pas bien de l’apparence qu’elles ne tourneroient pas autour de nous en vingt-quatre heures,
B984	/	/	Les comètes, qui sont étrangères dans notre tourbillon, qui y tiennent des routes si différentes, ne devraient-elles pas être dispensées de tourner toutes autour de nous dans ce même temps de vingt-quatre heures ? Mais non, planètes, étoiles fixes, comètes, tout tournera en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre. Encore, s’il y avait dans ces mouvemens quelques minutes de différence, on pourroit s’en contenter ; mais ils seront tous de la plus exacte égalité, ou plutôt de la seule égalité exacte qui soit au monde ; pas une minute de plus ou de moins. En vérité, cela doit être étrangement suspect.
B986	/	/	Et nos pendules ne marquent-elles pas une entière égalité ? Oh ! répondis-je, je récuse les pendules ; elles ne peuvent pas elles-mêmes être tout à fait justes, et quelquefois qu’elles le seront, en marquant qu’un tour de vingt-quatre heures sera plus long ou plus court qu’un autre, on aimera mieux les croire déréglées que de soupçonner la Terre de quelque irrégularité dans ses révolutions.
B991	/	/	qui marquent nécessairement que l’eau les a autrefois couvertes.
B995	/	/	ous ces changemens, qui ne sont sensibles qu’à nos meilleures lunettes,
B996	/	/	Mais enfin depuis trente ans on l’a démêlée sûrement, et elle a fait quelque temps les délices des astronomes, dont la curiosité avoit besoin d’être réveillée par quelque chose d’une espèce nouvelle
B997	/	/	les deux dernières lunes de Saturne, par exemple, ne les ont pas charmés ni ravis, comme avoient fait les satellites ou les lunes de Jupiter ; on s’accoutume à tout.
B999	/	/	Je croirois assez volontiers que la nature, selon le penchant que je lui connois à l’économie, ne se seroit servie que de ce seul moyen. Cependant, répliquai-je, malgré cette économie, il y auroit à l’égard de notre Terre deux causes de crépuscules, dont l’une, qui est l’air épais du Soleil, seroit assez inutile,
B1000	/	/	ne pourroit être qu’un objet de curiosité pour les habitants de l’observatoire
B1003	/	/	Voilà, Madame, répondis-je, un petit commencement de système que vous avez fait assez heureusement.
B1005	/	/	En fait des découvertes nouvelles, il ne se faut pas trop presser de raisonner, quoiqu’on en ait toujours assez d’envie, et les vrais philosophes sont comme les éléphants, qui en marchant ne posent jamais le second pied à terre, que le premier n’y soit bien affermi.
B1006	/	/	Je viens de vous dire, répondis-je, toutes les nouvelles que je sais du ciel, et je ne crois pas qu’il y en ait de plus fraîches. Je suis bien fâché qu’elles ne soient pas aussi sur prenantes et aussi merveilleuses que quelques observations que je lisois l’autre jour dans un abrégé des Annales de la Chine, écrit en latin.
B1007	/	/	Je suis bien fâché qu’elles ne soient pas aussi sur prenantes et aussi merveilleuses que quelques observations que je lisois l’autre jour dans un abrégé des Annales de la Chine, écrit en latin.
B1008	/	/	Cela n’a pas été vu pour une fois à la Chine,
B1009	/	/	j’ai trouvé cette observation en deux temps assez éloignés,
B1010	/	/	Il n’y a pas longtemps que tous nos philosophes se croyoient fondés en expérience pour soutenir que les cieux et tous les corps célestes étoient incorruptibles, et incapables de changement, et pendant ce temps-là d’autres hommes à l’autre bout de la Terre voyoient des étoiles se dissoudre par milliers, cela est assez différent.
B1013	/	/	Trahir la vérité
B1014	/	/	Vous n’avez point de conscience.
B1015	/	/	Je vous avoue, répondis-je, que je n’ai pas un grand zèle pour ces vérités-là
B1016	/	/	on ne persuade pas facilement aux hommes de mettre leur raison en la place de leurs yeux
B1017	/	/	Les horloges les plus communes et les plus grossières marquent les heures, il n’y a que celles qui sont travaillées avec plus d’art qui marquent les minutes. De même les esprits ordinaires sentent bien la différence d’une simple vraisemblance à une certitude entière ; mais il n’y a que les esprits fins qui sentent le plus ou le moins de certitude ou de vraisemblance, et qui en marquent, pour ainsi dire, les minutes par leur sentiment.
B1020	/	/	La raison a beau venir nous dire qu’il y a dans les planètes des campagnes, des prairies, la raison vient trop tard, le premier coup d’œil a fait son effet sur nous avant elle, nous ne la voulons plus écouter, les planètes ne sont que des corps lumineux
B1024	/	/	ils ne sont pas tout à fait certains, ils sont plus que vraisemblables, cela m’embarrasse trop
B1034	/	/	Je vous entends, interrompit la Marquise, et je crois que vous avez raison.
B1035	/	/	récompense
B1036	/	/	j’entends quelque visage à la manière de la Lune, car chacun transporte sur les objets les idées dont il est rempli
B1037	/	/	Il y a beaucoup d’apparence, répondis-je, qu’il en est arrivé.
B1043	/	/	Sur ce pied-là, je dois me dédire de ce que je vous avois dit, que la Lune ne devoit point avoir de crépuscules, faute d’être environnée d’un air épais ainsi que la Terre
B1044	/	/	l’une, qui est l’air épais du Soleil, seroit assez inutile, et ne pourroit être qu’un objet de curiosité pour les habitants de l’observatoire
B1046	/	/	Ils auroient tort, dit la Marquise, on n’est pas à mépriser pour être enveloppé d’un air épais, puisque le Soleil lui-même en a un qui l’enveloppe
B1049	/	/	Ce sont celles-là, Madame, auxquelles il vous appartient de vous occuper, et qui doivent composer toute votre philosophie.
B1050	/	/	Io scopersi pochi anni a dietro, come ben sa l’Altezza Vostra Serenissima, molti particolari nel cielo, stati invisibili sino a questa età
B1052	/	/	quasi che io di mia mano avessi tali cose collocate in cielo, per intorbidar la natura e le scienze.
B1053	/	/	E scordatisi in certo modo che la moltitudine de’ veri concorre all’investigazione, accrescimento e stabilimento delle discipline, e non alla diminuzione o destruzione,
B1054	/	/	dimostrandosi nell’istesso tempo più affezionati alle proprie opinioni che alle vere,
B1058	/	/	conclusione naturale attenente a i corpi celesti,
B1060	/	/	È accaduto poi che il tempo è andato successivamente scoprendo a tutti le verità prima da me additate,
B1061	/	/	e con la verità del fatto
B1063	/	/	come i più intendenti della scienza astronomica e della naturale restarono persuasi al mio primo avviso,
B1064	/	/	così si sono andati quietando di grado in grado gli altri tutti che non venivano mantenuti in negativa o in dubbio da altro che dall’inaspettata novità e dal non aver avuta occasione di vederne sensate esperienze
B1079	/	/	questa riforma, la quale allora rimase imperfetta solo perché non si aveva ancora esatta cognizione della giusta misura dell’anno e del mese lunare:
B1080	/	/	a lui fu dato carico dal Vescovo Semproniense, allora soprintendente a ques’impresa, di cercar con replicati studi e fatiche di venire in maggior lume e certezza di essi movimenti celesti; ond’egli, con fatiche veramente atlantiche e col suo mirabil ingegno, rimessosi a tale studio, si avanzò tanto in queste scienze, e a tale esattezza ridusse la notizia de’ periodi de’ movimenti celesti, che si guadagnò il titolo di sommo astronomo, e conforme alla sua dottrina non solamente si è poi regolato il calendario, ma si fabbricorno le tavole di tutti i movimenti de’ pianeti
B1082	/	/	La quale ora mentre si va scoprendo quanto ella sia ben fondata sopra ben manifeste esperienze e necessarie dimostrazioni,
B1084	/	/	manifeste esperienze
B1089	/	/	per dichiararla non pur falsa, ma eretica,
B1091	/	/	con quanto più pio e religioso zelo procedo io
B1092	/	/	propongo non che non si danni questo libro, ma che non si danni, come vorrebbono essi, senza intenderlo, ascoltarlo, né pur vederlo,
B1095	/	/	fondate prima sopra sensate esperienze ed accuratissime osservazioni.
B1104	/	/	però protestandomi (e anco credo che la sincerità mia si farà per se stessa manifesta)
B1106	/	/	mi dichiaro ancora non voler nell’istesse materie ingaggiar lite con nissuno
B1107	/	/	mi dichiaro ancora non voler nell’istesse materie ingaggiar lite con nissuno, ancor che fossero punti
B1110	/	/	ben che molte delle cose che io noto le abbia sentite con i proprii orecchi, liberamente ammetto e concedo a chi l’ha dette che dette non l’abbia, se così gli piace, confessando poter essere ch’io abbia frainteso; e però quando rispondo non sia detto per loro, ma per chi avesse quella opinione
B1119	/	/	sensate esperienze
B1137	/	/	sensate esperienze,
B1142	/	/	chi vuol por termine alli umani ingegni? Chi vorrà asserire, già essersi veduto e saputo tutto quello che è al mondo di sensibile e di scibile?
B1147	/	/	disordine veramente sarebbe l’aggiugnergli a richiesta di persone, le quali, oltre che noi ignoriamo se parlino inspirate da celeste virtù, chiaramente vediamo che in esse si potrebbe desiderare quella intelligenza che sarebbe necessaria prima a capire, e poi a redarguire, le dimostrazioni con le quali le acutissime scienze procedono nel confermare simili conclusioni.
B1159	/	/	Però grazie infinite doviamo render a Dio benedetto, il quale per sua benignità ci spoglia di questo timore, mentre spoglia d’autorità simil sorte di persone, riponendo il consultare, risolvere e decretare sopra determinazioni tanto importanti nella somma sapienza e bontà di prudentissimi padri e nella suprema autorità di quelli, che, scorti dallo Spirito Sabnto non possono se non santamente ordinare, permettendo che della leggerezza di quelli altri non sia fatto stima. Questa sorte d’uomini, per mio credere, son quelli contro i quali, non senza ragione, si riscaldano i gravi e santi scrittori, e de i quali in particolare scrive San Girolamo: «Hanc» (intendendo della Scrittura Sacra) «garrula anus, hanc delirus senex, hanc sophista verbosus, hanc universi præsumunt, lacerant, docent antequam discant. Alii, adducto supercilio, grandia verba trutinantes, inter mulierculas de Sacris Literis philosophantur; alii discunt, proh pudor, a fæminis quod viros doceant, et, ne parum hoc sit, quadam facilitate verborum, imo audacia, edisserunt aliis quod ipsi non intelligunt. Taceo de mei similibus, qui, si forte ad Scriputras Sanctas post seculares literas venerint, et sermone composito aurem populi mulserint, quidquid dixerint, hoc legem Dei putant, nec scire dignantur quid Prophetæ quid Apostoli senserint, sed ad sensum suum incongrua aptant testimonia; quasi grande sit, et non vitiosissimum docendi genus, depravare sententias, et ad voluntatem suam Scripturam trahere repugnantem.»
B1160	/	/	Io non voglio metter nel numero di simili scrittori secolari alcuni teologi, riputati da me per uomini di profonda dottrina e di santissimi costumi, e per ciò tenuti in grande stima e venerazione
B1165	/	/	quando nell’inferiore scienza si avesse alcuna conlusione per sicura, in vigor di dimostrazioni o di esperienze,
B1168	/	/	Imperò che ella potrebbe esser tale, o vero perché quello che da tutte l’altre scienze viene insegnato, si trovasse compreso e dimostrato in lei, ma con mezi più eccellenti e con più sublime dottrina, nel modo che, per essempio, le regole del misurare i campi e del conteggiare molto più eminentemente si contengono nell’aritmetica e geometria d’Euclide, che nelle pratiche degli agrimensori e de’ computisti
B1172	/	/	non con, l’istessa facilità si possono mutare le conclusioni dimostrate circa le cose della natura e del cielo, che le opinioni circa a quello che sia lecito o no in un contratto, in un censo, in un cambio
B1176	/	/	in questo particolare accadrà che i seguaci di questa opinione, quanto più andran rivolgendo le carte, esaminando le ragioni, replicando l’osservazione e riscontrando l’esperienze, tanto più si confermino in questa credenza

B1661	/	/	Snow-White looked out and said, Go on your way. I am not allowed to let anyone in.
B1662	/	/	You surely may take a look, said the old woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it up. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door.

Arriving home, he gave his stepdaughters the things that they had asked for, and he gave Cinderella the twig from the hazel bush
B1727	/	/	Cinderella thanked him, went to her mother's grave, and planted the branch on it
B1728	/	/	Cinderella went to this tree three times every day, and beneath it she wept and prayed
B1732	/	/	He had them bring him an ax and a pick so that he could break the pigeon coop apart, but no one was inside
B1734	/	/	The prince had waited until she came, then immediately took her by the hand, and danced only with her. When others came and asked her to dance with them, he said, She is my dance partner.
B1735	/	/	I believe she has climbed up the pear tree. The father thought, Could it be Cinderella? He had an ax brought to him and cut down the tree, but no one was in it
B1738	/	/	The prince danced only with her, and whenever anyone else asked her to dance, he would say, She is my dance partner.
B1739	/	/	The prince, however, had set a trap. He had had the entire stairway smeared with pitch. When she ran down the stairs, her left slipper stuck in the pitch
B1740	/	/	No one shall be my wife except for the one whose foot fits this golden shoe.
B1744	/	/	She sat down on a stool, pulled her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, and it fitted her perfectly
B1746	/	/	No one knew where he took them, for none of them ever returned
B1757	/	/	She took the keys and the egg, and promised to take good care of everything
B1761	/	/	The second sister brought him a piece of bread
B1762	/	/	the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread
B1763	/	/	He appeared to be a poor, weak beggar, and he carried a pack basket on his back, as though he wanted to collect some benevolent offerings in it. He asked for a bit to eat, and when the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread
B1764	/	/	he saw from the red stain that she had been in the blood chamber
B1771	/	/	In spite of this she proceeded to gather their parts together, placing them back in order: head, body, arms, and legs. Then, when nothing else was missing, the parts began to move
B1772	/	/	When the man returned home he immediately demanded the keys and the egg, and when he was unable to detect any trace of blood on them, he said, You have passed the test. You shall be my bride.
B1777	/	/	The moment is here when I can rescue you. The evildoer himself shall carry you home. As soon as you have arrived at home send help to me.
B1783	/	/	When everything was ready she dipped herself into a barrel of honey, then cut open the bed and rolled around in it until she looked like a strange bird, and no one would have been able to recognize her
B1786	/	/	the bride's brothers and relatives arrived. They had been sent to rescue her
B1787	/	/	After he and all his guests had gone into the house, the bride's brothers and relatives arrived. They had been sent to rescue her. After closing up all the doors of the house so that no one could escape, they set it afire, and the sorcerer, together with his gang, all burned to death
B1789	/	/	As soon as he had gone she walked about in the house from top to bottom examining everything
B1790	/	/	She examined the key. It looked like any other one. She put it into the lock and twisted it a little, and then the door sprang open
B1792	/	/	Every time that he stopped walking, someone called out, and he had to walk on until, groaning and out of breath, he brought the basket with the gold and the two girls to their parents' house
B1794	/	/	Underway some of the wedding guests met her, and they asked, You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from? I am coming from Fitcher's house.
B1795	/	/	You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from? I am coming from Fitcher's house.
B1796	/	/	Why do you torment yourself with chopping wood? I will make you rich if you will promise me that which is standing behind your mill.
B1798	/	/	All at once all the chests and boxes are full, and no one brought it here, and I don't know where it came from.
B1800	/	/	The miller's daughter was a beautiful and pious girl, and she lived the three years worshipping God and without sin
B1801	/	/	When the time was up and the day came when the evil one was to get her, she washed herself clean and drew a circle around herself with chalk
B1807	/	/	She answered, Dear father, do with me what you will. I am your child, and with that she stretched forth both hands and let her father chop them off
B1808	/	/	Compassionate people will give me as much as I need
B1810	/	/	The miller spoke to her, I have gained great wealth through you. I shall take care of you in splendor as long as you live.
B1812	/	/	He closed a head gate, so that the moat dried up, and she could walk through
B1813	/	/	Then she kneeled down and, crying out to God the Lord, she prayed. Suddenly an angel appeared
B1814	/	/	She entered the garden, and the angel went with her
B1818	/	/	The king said, How did the spirit get across the water? And where did it go after it had eaten the pear?
B1819	/	/	The king said, If what you said is true, I will keep watch with you tonight.
B1820	/	/	After it was dark the king entered the garden, bringing a priest with him who was to talk to the spirit
B1821	/	/	After it was dark the king entered the garden, bringing a priest with him who was to talk to the spirit. All three sat down under the tree and kept watch
B1823	/	/	She answered, I am not a spirit, but a poor human who has been abandoned by everyone except God.
B1825	/	/	She gave birth to a beautiful son. The old mother quickly wrote this in a letter, giving the joyful news to the king
B1831	/	/	Then she said to the queen, I cannot have you killed as the king has ordered, but you can no longer stay here. Go out into the wide world with your child, and never come back.
B1832	/	/	She came to a great, wild forest where she got onto her knees and prayed to God. Then the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a small house
B1834	/	/	On it was a small sign with the words, Here anyone can live free.
B1835	/	/	Then the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a small house. On it was a small sign with the words, Here anyone can live free.
B1838	/	/	And through the grace of God and her own piety her chopped-off hands grew back
B1840	/	/	Then she continued to speak, I did what you ordered, and showed him as proof the eyes and the tongue
B1841	/	/	Then the king began to weep even more bitterly for his poor wife and his little son, until the old woman had mercy and said to him, Be satisfied that she is still alive. I secretly had a doe killed and took the proofs from it. I tied your wife's child onto her back and told her to go out into the wide world, and she had to promise never to come back here, because you were so angry with her.
B1842	/	/	He neither ate nor drank during the entire time, but God kept him alive
B1843	/	/	Finally he came to a great forest, where he found a little house with a sign containing the words,  Here anyone can live free.
B1844	/	/	He answered, I have been traveling about for nearly seven years looking for my wife and her child, but I cannot find them.
B1845	/	/	The angel offered him something to eat and drink, but he did not take it, wanting only to rest a little
B1847	/	/	Mother, dear, how can I cover my father's face? I have no father in this world. I have learned to pray, 'Our father which art in heaven,' and you have said that my father is in heaven, and that he is our dear God. How can I know such a wild man? He is not my father.
B1850	/	/	The angel went into the other room, brought back the silver hands, and showed them to him. Now he saw for sure that it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed them, and rejoiced, and said, A heavy stone has fallen from my heart.
B1852	/	/	they went back home to his old mother. There was great joy everywhere, and the king and the queen conducted their wedding ceremony once again, and they lived happily until their blessed end
B1853	/	/	He took her home with him to his royal castle, and because she was so beautiful and pure he loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her, and took her as his wife
B1855	/	/	The king finally came back home from the battlefield, and the first thing he wanted to do was to see his wife and their child
B1856	/	/	Then the king said, I will go as far as the sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have found my dear wife and my child again, provided that in the meantime they have not died or perished from hunger.
B1858	/	/	How did you know that I am a queen?
B1859	/	/	She said, I am your wife, and this is your son Filled-with-Grief.
B1861	/	/	This frightened the father, and he promised to obey him
B1862	/	/	My child, if I do not chop off both of your hands, then the devil will take me away, and in my fear I have promised him to do this
B1866	/	/	by the light of the moon she saw that inside there were trees full of beautiful fruit
B1868	/	/	She saw a fruit tree with beautiful pears, but they had all been counted
B1869	/	/	She stepped up to the tree and ate from it with her mouth, enough to satisfy her hunger, but no more
B1879	/	/	The angel said to her, Go into the next room with your child. Your husband has come.
B1880	/	/	The angel said to her, Go into the next room with your child. Your husband has come. She went to where he was lying
B1889	/	/	He who says A must also say B, and because he had given in the first time, he had to do so the second time as well
B1890	/	/	But he comforted his little sister and said, Don't cry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will help us.
B1892	/	/	When it was midday Gretel shared her bread with Hansel
B1896	/	/	In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones
B1897	/	/	The duckling came up to them, and Hansel climbed onto it, then asked his little sister to sit down next to him.  No, answered Gretel. That would be too heavy for the duckling. It should take us across one at a time.
B1898	/	/	Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets
B1900	/	/	Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way.
B1903	/	/	But now we must leave, said Hansel, and get out of these witch-woods.
B1906	/	/	I know what to do
B1907	/	/	they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching
B1909	/	/	We cannot get across, said Hansel. I cannot see a walkway or a bridge. There are no boats here, answered Gretel, but there is a white duck swimming. If I ask it, it will help us across.
B1911	/	/	Gretel put the bread under her apron, because Hansel's pockets were full of stones
B1912	/	/	as soon as the adults had fallen asleep, he got up, pulled on his jacket, opened the lower door, and crept outside. The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house were glistening like silver coins. Hansel bent over and filled his jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit
B1913	/	/	Don't worry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will not forsake us. Then he went back to bed
B1915	/	/	Then all together they set forth into the woods
B1921	/	/	Hansel comforted her, Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way.
B1922	/	/	After the full moon had come up, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles that glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked throughout the entire night, and as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father's house
B1924	/	/	On the way to the woods, Hansel crumbled his piece in his pocket, then often stood still, and threw crumbs onto the ground
B1927	/	/	Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home.
B1931	/	/	Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far
B1932	/	/	Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching
B1933	/	/	Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch's house
B1939	/	/	The good servant, who understood little about money, put his wealth into his pocket, and thought, Ah, now that I have a full purse, why should I worry and continue to plague myself with hard work? So he set forth, uphill and down, singing and jumping for joy
B1941	/	/	Listen, said the dwarf, I am a poor and needy man. Give me your three hellers. I can no longer work, but you are young and can easily earn your bread.
B1942	/	/	Listen, said the dwarf, I am a poor and needy man. Give me your three hellers. I can no longer work, but you are young and can easily earn your bread. Now because the servant had a good heart and felt pity for the dwarf, he gave him his three hellers, saying, In God's name, I won't miss them. Then the dwarf said, Because I see that you have a good heart I will grant you three wishes, one for each heller. They shall all be fulfilled.
B1945	/	/	Judge, sir, he said
B1946	/	/	The judge asked
B1947	/	/	God forbid, said the Jew. He didn't have a naked dagger, but rather a blowpipe hanging from his back, and a fiddle from his neck. The scoundrel can easily be recognized.
B1948	/	/	The judge sent his people out after him. They found the good servant, who had been walking along quite slowly. And they found the purse with the money on him as well
B1949	/	/	When he was brought before the judge he said, I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money
B1950	/	/	He offered it to me freely
B1951	/	/	God forbid! cried the Jew. He is reaching for lies like flies on the wall.
B1952	/	/	The judge did not believe his story, and said, That is a poor excuse. No Jew would do that.
B1955	/	/	he ran into the town to the judge
B1956	/	/	Yes, said the judge, if you do not ask for your life.
B1957	/	/	The servant walked quietly up the ladder with the hangman, but on the last rung he turned around and said to the judge, Grant me just one request before I die. Yes, said the judge, if you do not ask for your life.
B1958	/	/	But the judge said, Why should I not grant him this short pleasure? It has been promised to him, and he shall have it.
B1960	/	/	the judge, the clerks, and the court officials
B1961	/	/	The hangman released the good servant and made ready to dance
B1962	/	/	The judge and the Jew were out in front and were the best at jumping
B1963	/	/	Soon everyone who had gathered in the marketplace out of curiosity was dancing with them, old and young, fat and thin, all together with each other. Even the dogs that had run along with the crowd stood up on their hind legs and hopped along as well
B1964	/	/	the judge, quite out of breath, shouted
B1967	/	/	He went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground gasping for air, and said, You rogue, now confess where you got the money, or I will take my fiddle off my neck and begin to play again.
B1968	/	/	With that the judge had the Jew led to the gallows and hanged as a thief
B1970	/	/	At the second stroke they all lifted their legs
B1971	/	/	At the third stroke everyone jumped up and began to dance
B1972	/	/	The longer he played, the higher the dancers jumped
B1980	/	/	Grant me just one request before I die. Yes, said the judge, if you do not ask for your life.
B1983	/	/	As he played the first stroke, they all began to quiver and shake
B1993	/	/	And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace
B1995	/	/	This made the woman angry, but she said, Yes, when he comes home from school.
B1996	/	/	Mother, said the little daughter, is brother not to have one too? This made the woman angry, but she said, Yes, when he comes home from school.
B1997	/	/	Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, My son, do you want an apple?
B2003	/	/	Marlene, said the mother, what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it. It cannot be helped now. We will cook him into stew.
B2009	/	/	My mother, she killed me, My father, he ate me, My sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I
B2012	/	/	and they all came out into the street and looked at the bird and saw how beautiful he was, and what fine red and green feathers he had, and how his neck was like pure gold, and how his eyes shone like stars in his head
B2016	/	/	In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack
B2019	/	/	My father, he ate me
B2020	/	/	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf
B2023	/	/	Yes, he said, if it belonged only to me, you should have it. Yes, said the others, if he sings again he can have it.
B2029	/	/	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I
B2032	/	/	My father, he ate me, Then the woman fell down as if she were dead
B2035	/	/	And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death
B2036	/	/	when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate
B2040	/	/	Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it
B2043	/	/	He invited not only his relatives, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women so that they would be kindly disposed toward the child
B2046	/	/	the wise women presented the child with their magic gifts. The one gave her virtue, the second one beauty, the third one wealth, and so on with everything that one could wish for on earth
B2053	/	/	When he touched her with the kiss Little Brier-Rose opened her eyes, awoke, and looked at him kindly
B2054	/	/	They went downstairs together
B2059	/	/	Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap
B2060	/	/	One day her mother said to her, Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your grandmother. And when you enter her parlor, don't forget to say 'Good morning,' and don't peer into all the corners first. I'll do everything just right, said Little Red Cap, shaking her mother's hand
B2061	/	/	She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him
B2062	/	/	Her house is good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place, said Little Red Cap
B2064	/	/	But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door
B2069	/	/	Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have! All the better to hear you with. Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have! All the better to see you with. Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have! All the better to grab you with! Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have! All the better to eat you with!
B2070	/	/	He was about to aim his rifle when it occurred to him that the wolf might have eaten the grandmother, and that she still might be rescued. So instead of shooting, he took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the wolf's belly
B2072	/	/	Then Little Red Cap fetched some large stones. She filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he immediately fell down dead. The three of them were happy
B2073	/	/	He stepped into the parlor, and when he approached the bed, he saw the wolf lying there
B2074	/	/	They also tell how Little Red Cap was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time, when another wolf spoke to her and wanted her to leave the path. But Little Red Cap took care and went straight to grandmother's
B2076	/	/	Come, said the grandmother. Let's lock the door, so he can't get in.
B2078	/	/	But the grandmother saw what he was up to. There was a large stone trough in front of the house. Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap, she said to the child. Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough. Little Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned

B2081	/	/	They remained silent, and did not open the door
B2082	/	/	Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next
B2083	/	/	she came to be known as Little Red Cap
B2087	/	/	Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth
B2088	/	/	she knew that the mirror spoke the truth
B2089	/	/	it is true
B2090	/	/	she had no peace day and night
B2091	/	/	Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her
B2094	/	/	Then she began to run. She ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and wild animals jumped at her, but they did her no harm. She ran as far as her feet could carry her, and just as evening was about to fall she saw a little house and went inside in order to rest
B2099	/	/	The seventh dwarf had to sleep with his companions, one hour with each one
B2100	/	/	they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed
B2102	/	/	there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with snow-white sheets
B2103	/	/	Snow-White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate, and from each mug she drank a drop of wine
B2104	/	/	If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want.
B2107	/	/	she knew that the mirror did not lie
B2110	/	/	Knocking on the door she called out, Beautiful wares for sale, for sale! Snow-White peered out the window and said, Good day, dear woman, what do you have for sale?
B2111	/	/	I can let that honest woman in, thought Snow-White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty bodice lace
B2114	/	/	all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow-White had come back to life
B2118	/	/	After they had agreed on the purchase, the old woman said, Now let me comb your hair properly.
B2125	/	/	Now the apple had been so artfully made that only the red half was poisoned
B2128	/	/	If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want. Yes, said Snow-White, with all my heart.
B2133	/	/	They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days
B2134	/	/	They lifted her up and looked for something poisonous. They undid her laces. They combed her hair. They washed her with water and wine. But nothing helped. The dear child was dead, and she remained dead. They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days. They were going to bury her, but she still looked as fresh as a living person, and still had her beautiful red cheeks
B2135	/	/	They said, We cannot bury her in the black earth,
B2137	/	/	Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain, and one of them always stayed with it and watched over her
B2138	/	/	The animals too came and mourned for Snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and finally a dove
B2139	/	/	Then they put a pair of iron shoes into burning coals. They were brought forth with tongs and placed before her. She was forced to step into the red-hot shoes and dance until she fell down dead

B2266	/	/	who knows, but that the Industry of man, following this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet higher.
B2267	/	/	There may be also some other mechanical wayes found out, of sensibly perceiving the effluvia of Bodies; several Instances of which, were it here proper, I could give of Mineral steams and exhalations; and it seems not impossible, but that by some such wayes improved, may be discovered, what Minerals lye buried under the Earth, without the trouble to dig for them; some things to confirm this Conjecture may be found in Agricola, and other Writers of Minerals, speaking of the Vegetables that are apt to thrive, or pine, in those steams.  Whether also those steams, which seem to issue out of the Earth, and mix with the Air (and so to precipitate some aqueous Exhalations, wherewith ’tis impregnated) may not be by some way detected before they produce the effect, seems hard to determine; yet something of this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the Air; by which I constantly find, that before, and during the time of rainy weather, the pressure of the Air is less, and in dry weather, but especially when an Eastern Wind (which having past over vast tracts of Land is heavy with Earthy Particles) blows, it is much more, though these changes are varied according to very odd Laws.  The Instrument is this. I prepare a pretty capacious Bolt-head AB, with a small stem about two foot and a half long DC; upon the end of this D I put on a small bended Glass, or brazen syphon DEF (open at D, E and F, but to be closed with cement at F and E, as occasion serves) whose stem F should be about six or eight inches long, but the bore of it not above half an inch diameter, and very even; these I fix very strongly together by the help of very hard Cement, and then fit the whole Glass ABCDEF into a long Board, or Frame, in such manner, that almost half the head AB may lye buried in a concave Hemisphere cut into the Board RS; Schem. 1. Fig. 1. then I place it so on the Board RS, as is exprest in the first figure of the first Scheme; and fix it very firm and steady in that posture, so as that the weight of the Mercury that is afterwards to be put into it, may not in the least shake or stir it; then drawing a line XY on the Frame RT, so that it may divide the ball into two equal parts, or that it may pass, as ’twere, through the center of the ball. I begin from that, and divide all the rest of the Board towards UT into inches, and the inches between the 25 and the end E (which need not be above two or three and thirty inches distant from the line XY) I subdivide into Decimals; then stopping the end F with soft Cement, or soft Wax, I invert the Frame, placing the head downwards, and the Orifice E upwards; and by it, with a small Funnel, I fill the whole Glass with Quicksilver; then by stopping the small Orifice E with my finger, I oftentimes erect and invert the whole Glass and Frame, and thereby free the Quicksilver and Glass from all the bubbles or parcels of lurking Air; then inverting it as before, I fill it top full with clear and well strain’d Quicksilver, and having made ready a small ball of pretty hard Cement, by heat made very soft, I press it into the hole E, and thereby stop it very fast; and to secure this Cement from flying out afterward, I bind over it a piece of Leather, that is spread over in the inside with Cement, and wound about it while the Cement is hot: Having thus fastned it, I gently erect again the Glass after this manner: I first let the Frame down edge-wayes, till the edge RV touch the Floor, or ly horizontal; and then in that edging posture raise the end RS; this I do, that if there chance to be any Air hidden in the small Pipe E, it may ascend into the Pipe F, and not into the Pipe DC: Having thus erected it, and hung it by the hole Q, or fixt it perpendicularly by any other means, I open the end F, and by a small Syphon I draw out the Mercury so long, till I find the surface of it AB in the head to touch exactly the line XY; at which time I immediately take away the Syphon, and if by chance it be run somewhat below the line XY, by pouring in gently a little Mercury at F, I raise it again to its desired height, by this contrivance I make all the sensible rising and falling of the Mercury to be visible in the surface of the Mercury in the Pipe F, and scarce any in the head AB. But because there really is some small change of the upper surface also, I find by several Observations how much it rises in the Ball, and falls in the Pipe F, to make the distance between the two surfaces an inch greater then it was before; and the measure that it falls in the Pipe is the length of the inch by which I am to mark the parts of the Tube F, or the Board on which it lyes, into inches and Decimals: Having thus justned and divided it, I have a large Wheel MNOP, whose outmost limb is divided into two hundred equal parts; this by certain small Pillars is fixt on the Frame RT, in the manner exprest in the Figure. In the middle of this, on the back side, in a convenient frame, is placed a small Cylinder, whose circumference is equal to twice the length of one of those divisions, which I find answer to an inch of ascent, or descent, of Mercury: This Cylinder I, is movable on a very small Needle, on the end of which is fixt a very light Index KL, all which are so pois’d on the Axis, or Needle, that no part is heavier then another: Then about this Cylinder is wound a small Clew of Silk, with two small steel Bullets at each end of it GH; one of these, which is somewhat the heavier, ought to be so big, as freely to move to and fro in the Pipe F; by means of which contrivance, every the least variation of the height of the Mercury will be made exceeding visible by the motion to and fro of the small Index KL.  But this is but one way of discovering the effluvia of the Earth mixt with the Air; there may be perhaps many others, witness the Hygroscope, an Instrument whereby the watery steams volatile in the Air are discerned, which the Nose it self is not able to find. This I have describ’d in the following Tract in the Description of the Beard of a wild Oat. Others there are, may be discovered both by the Nose, and by other wayes also. Thus the smoak of burning Wood is smelt, seen, and sufficiently felt by the eyes: The fumes of burning Brimstone are smelt and discovered also by the destroying the Colours of Bodies, as by the whitening of a red Rose: And who knows, but that the Industry of man, following this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet higher.  ’Tis not improbable also, but that our taste may be very much improv’d, either by preparing our taste for the Body, as, after eating bitter things, Wine, or other Vinous liquors, are more sensibly tasted; or else by preparing Bodies for our tast; as the dissolving of Metals with acid Liquors, make them tastable, which were before altogether insipid; thus Lead becomes sweeter then Sugar, and Silver more bitter then Gall, Copper and Iron of most loathsome tasts. And indeed the business of this sense being to discover the presence of dissolved Bodies in Liquors put on the Tongue, or in general to discover that a fluid body has some solid body dissolv’d in it, and what they are; whatever contrivance makes this discovery improves this sense. In this kind the mixtures of Chymical Liquors afford many Instances; as the sweet Vinegar that is impregnated with Lead may be discovered to be so by the affusion of a little of an Alcalizate solution: The bitter liquor of Aqua fortis and Silver may be discover’d to be charg’d with that Metal, by laying in it some plates of Copper: ’Tis not improbable also, but there may be multitudes of other wayes of discovering the parts dissolv’d, or dissoluble in liquors; and what is this discovery but a kind of secundary tasting.  ’Tis not improbable also, but that the sense of feeling may be highly improv’d, for that being a sense that judges of the more gross and robust motions of the Particles of Bodies, seems capable of being improv’d and assisted very many wayes. Thus for the distinguishing of Heat and Cold, the Weather-glass and Thermometer, which I have describ’d in this following Treatise, do exceedingly perfect it; by each of which the least variations of heat or cold, which the most Acute sense is not able to distinguish, are manifested. This is oftentimes further promoted also by the help of Burning-glasses, and the like, which collect and unite the radiating heat. Thus the roughness and smoothness of a Body is made much more sensible by the help of a Microscope, then by the most tender and delicate Hand. Perhaps, a Physitian might, by several other tangible proprieties, discover the constitution of a Body as well as by the Pulse. I do but instance in these, to shew what possibility there may be of many others, and what probability and hopes there were of finding them, if this method were followed; for the Offices of the five Senses being to detect either the subtil and curious Motions propagated through all pellucid or perfectly homogeneous Bodies; Or the more gross and vibrative Pulse communicated through the Air and all other convenient mediums, whether fluid or solid: Or the effluvia of Bodies dissolv’d in the Air; Or the particles of bodies dissolv’d or dissoluble in Liquors, or the more quick and violent shaking motion of heat in all or any of these: whatsoever does any wayes promote any of these kinds of criteria, does afford a way of improving some one sense. And what a multitude of these would a diligent Man meet with in his inquiries? And this for the helping and promoting the sensitive faculty only.  Next, as for the Memory, or retentive faculty, we may be sufficiently instructed from the written Histories of civil actions, what great assistance may be afforded the Memory, in the committing to writing things observable in natural operations. If a Physitian be therefore accounted the more able in his Faculty, because he has had long experience and practice, the remembrance of which, though perhaps very imperfect, does regulate all his after actions: What ought to be thought of that man, that has not only a perfect register of his own experience, but is grown old with the experience of many hundreds of years, and many thousands of men.  And though of late, men, beginning to be sensible of this convenience, have here and there registred and printed some few Centuries, yet for the most part they are set down very lamely and imperfectly, and, I fear, many times not so truly, they seeming, several of them, to be design’d more for Ostentation then publique use: For, not to instance, that they do, for the most part, omit those Experiences they have made, wherein their Patients have miscarried, it is very easie to be perceiv’d, that they do all along hyperbolically extol their own Prescriptions, and vilifie those of others. Notwithstanding all which, these kinds of Histories are generally esteem’d useful, even to the ablest Physitian
B2268	/	/	What may not be expected from the rational or deductive Faculty that is furnisht with such Materials
B2269	/	/	How neer the nature of Axioms must all those Propositions be which are examin’d before so many Witnesses?
B2271	/	/	The Invention of a way to find the Longitude of places is easily perform’d, and that to as great perfection as is desir’d, or to at great an accurateness as the Latitude of places can be found at Sea; and perhaps yet also to a greater certainty then that has been hitherto found, as I shall very speedily freely manifest to the world. The way of flying in the Air seems principally unpracticable, by reason of the want of strength in humane muscles; if therefore that could be suppli’d, it were, I think, easie to make twenty contrivances to perform the office of Wings: What Attempts also I have made for the supplying that Defect, and my successes therein, which, I think, are wholly new, and not inconsiderable, I shall in another place relate.  ’Tis not unlikely also, but that Chymists, if they followed this method, might find out their so much sought for Alkahest. What an universal Menstruum, which dissolves all sorts of Sulphureous Bodies, I have discover’d (which has not been before taken notice of as such) I have shewn in the sixteenth Observation.  What a prodigious variety of Inventions in Anatomy has this latter Age afforded, even in our own Bodies in the very Heart, by which we live, and the Brain, which is the seat of our knowledge of other things? witness all the excellent Works of Pecquet, Bartholinus, Billius, and many others; and at home, of Doctor Harvy, Doctor Ent, Doctor Willis, Doctor Glisson. In Celestial Observations we have far exceeded all the Antients, even the Chaldeans and Egyptians themselves, whose vast Plains, high Towers, and clear Air, did not give them so great advantages over us, as have over them by our Glasses. By the help of which, they have been very much outdone by the famous Galileo, Hevelius, Zulichem; and our own Countrymen, Mr. Rook, Doctor Wren, and the great Ornament of our Church and Nation, the Lord Bishop of Exeter. And to say no more in Aerial Discoveries, there has been a wonderful progress made by the Noble Engine of the most Illustrious Mr. Boyle, whom it becomes me to mention with all honour, not only as my particular Patron, but as the Patron of Philosophy it self; which he every day increases by his Labours, and adorns by his Example.
B2272	/	/	And I do not only propose this kind of Experimental Philosophy as a matter of high rapture and delight of the mind, but even as a material and sensible Pleasure
B2273	/	/	Experimental Philosophy
B2274	/	/	the greatness of your Mercy
B2275	/	/	The good success of all these great Men, and many others, and the now seemingly great obviousness of most of their and divers other Inventions,
B2276	/	/	puts me in mind to recommend such Studies
B2277	/	/	the prosecution of them by such methods
B2278	/	/	So vast it the variety of Objects which will come under their Inspections, so many different wayes there are of handling them, so great is the satisfaction of finding out new things, that I dare compare the contentment which they will injoy, not only to that of contemplation, but even to that which most men prefer of the very Senses themselves
B2279	/	/	there has not been any inquiry or Problem in Mechanicks, that I have hitherto propounded to my self, but by a certain method (which I may on some other opportunity explain) I have been able presently to examine the possibility of it; and if so, as easily to excogitate divers wayes of performing it: And indeed it is possible to do as much by this method in Mechanicks, as by Algebra can be perform’d in Geometry. Nor can I at all doubt, but that the same method is as applicable to Physical Enquiries, and as likely to find and reap thence as plentiful a crop of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren, but may with this good husbandry be highly improv’d
B2280	/	/	it is possible to do as much by this method in Mechanicks, as by Algebra can be perform’d in Geometry. Nor can I at all doubt, but that the same method is as applicable to Physical Enquiries, and as likely to find and reap thence as plentiful a crop of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren, but may with this good husbandry be highly improv’d
B2281	/	/	Toward the prosecution of this method in Physical Inquiries, I have here and there gleaned up an handful of Observations, in the collection of most of which I made use of Microscopes, and some other Glasses and Instruments that improve the sense
B2284	/	/	to make us, with the great Conqueror, to be affected that we have not yet overcome one World when there are so many others to be discovered, every considerable improvement of Telescopes or Microscopes producing new Worlds and Terra-Incognita’s to our view
B2285	/	/	The Glasses I used were of our English make, but though very good of the kind, yet far short of what might be expected, could we once find a way of making Glasses Elliptical, or of some more true shape; for though both Microscopes, and Telescopes, as they now are, will magnifie an Object about a thousand thousand times bigger then it appears to the naked eye; yet the Apertures of the Object-glasses are so very small, that very few Rays are admitted, and even of those few there are so many false, that the Object appears dark and indistinct: And indeed these inconveniences are such, as seem inseparable from Spherical Glasses, even when most exactly made; but the way we have hitherto made use of for that purpose is so imperfect, that there may be perhaps ten wrought before one be made tolerably good, and most of those ten perhaps every one differing in goodness one from another, which is an Argument, that the way hitherto used is, at least, very uncertain. So that these Glasses have a double defect; the one, that very few of them are exactly true wrought; the other, that even of those that are best among them, none will admit a sufficient number of Rayes to magnifie the Object beyond a determinate bigness. Against which Inconveniences the only Remedies I have hitherto met with are these
B2286	/	/	for Microscopes (where the Object we view is near and within our power) the best way of making it appear bright in the Glass, is to cast a great quantity of light on it by means of convex glasses, for thereby, though the aperture be very small, yet there will throng in through it such multitudes, that an Object will by this means indure to be magnifi’d as much again as it would be without it
B2287	/	/	As for Telescopes, the only improvement they seem capable of, is the increasing of their length
B2288	/	/	I have experimentally observ’d in one of that length made by Mr. Richard Reives here at London
B2289	/	/	And for performing both these, I cannot imagine any way more easie, and more exact, then by this following Engine, by means of which, any Glasses, of what length soever, may be speedily made. It seems the most easie, because with one and the same Tool may be with care ground an Object Glass, of any length or breadth requisite, and that with very little or no trouble in fitting the Engine, and without much skill in the Grinder. It seems to be the most exact, for to the very last stroke the Glass does regulate and rectifie the Tool to its exact Figure; and the longer or more the Tool and Glass are wrought together, the more exact will both of them be of the desir’d Figure. Further, the motions of the Glass and Tool do so cross each other, that there is not one point of eithers Surface, but has thousands of cross motions thwarting it, so that there can be no kind of Rings or Gutters made either in the Tool or Glass
B2290	/	/	supposing the Mandrils well made, and of a good length, and supposing great care be used in working and polishing them, I see no reason, but that a Glass of a thousand, nay of ten thousand foot long, may be as well made as one of ten
B2292	/	/	we are certain, from the Laws of refraction
B2293	/	/	I have experimentally found to be so, by an Instrument I shall presently describe
B2294	/	/	I have experimentally found to be so
B2295	/	/	if Glasses could be made of those kind of Figures, or some other, such as the most incomparable Des Cartes has invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works, we might hope for a much greater perfection of Opticks then can be rationally expected from spherical ones
B2296	/	/	as the most incomparable Des Cartes has invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works
B2298	/	/	though I know two or three wayes, which, as far as I have yet considered, seem very probable, and may invite me to make a tryal as soon as I have an opportunity, of which I may hereafter perhaps acquaint the world
B2299	/	/	to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals; and to let them see that the laws of Refraction are not only notional
B2300	/	/	to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals
B2301	/	/	By means of this Instrument I can with little trouble, and a very small quantity of any Liquor, examine, most accurately, the refraction of it not only for one inclination, but for all; and thereby am inabled to make very accurate Tables
B2302	/	/	I have also experimentally made, and find, that Oyl of Turpentine has a much greater Refraction then Spirit of Wine, though it be lighter; and that Spirit of Wine has a greater Refraction then Water, though it be lighter also; but that salt Water also has a greater Refraction then fresh, though it be heavier: but Alum water has a less refraction then common Water, though heavier also. So that it seems, as to the refraction made in a Liquor, the specifick gravity is of no efficacy. By this I have also found that look what proportion the Sine of the Angle of one Inclination has to the Sine of the Angle of Refraction, correspondent to it, the same proportion have all the Sines of other Inclinations to the Sines of their appropriate Refractions.
B2303	/	/	Now though this were the Instrument I made most use of, yet I have made several other Tryals with other kinds of Microscopes, which both for matter and form were very different from common spherical Glasses. I have made a Microscope with one piece of Glass, both whose surfaces were plains. I have made another only with a plano concave, without any kind of reflection, divers also by means of reflection. I have made others of Waters, Gums, Resins, Salts, Arsenick, Oyls, and with divers other mixtures of watery and oyly Liquors. And indeed the subject is capable of a great variety; but I find generally none more useful then that which is made with two Glasses, such as I have already describ’d.
B2305	/	/	this was undertaken in prosecution of the Design which the ROYAL SOCIETY has propos’d to it self. For the Members of the Assembly having before their eys so many fatal Instances of the errors and falshoods, in which the greatest part of mankind has so long wandred, because they rely’d upon the strength of humane Reason alone, have begun anew to correct all Hypotheses by sense, as Seamen do their dead Reckonings by Cœlestial Observations; and to this purpose it has been their principal indeavour to enlarge & strengthen the Senses by Medicine, and by such outward Instruments as are proper for their particular works
B2306	/	/	in prosecution of the Design which the ROYAL SOCIETY has propos’d to it self
B2310	/	/	And the ends of all these Inquiries they intend to be the Pleasure of Contemplative minds, but above all, the ease and dispatch of the labours of mens hands. They do indeed neglect no opportunity to bring all the rare things of Remote Countries within the compass of their knowledge and practice
B2312	/	/	And of this kind I ought not to conceal one particular Generosity, which more nearly concerns my self. It is the munificence of Sir John Cutler
B2313	/	/	endowing a Lecture for the promotion of Mechanick Arts, to be governed and directed by This Society.This Bounty I mention for the Honourableness of the thing it self, and for the expectation which I have of the efficacy of the Example
B2316	/	/	If these my first Labours shall be any wayes useful to inquiring men, I must attribute the incouragement and promotion of them to a very Reverend and Learned Person, of whom this ought in justice to be said, That there is scarce any one Invention, which this Nation has produc’d in our Age, but it has some way or other been set forward by his assistance
B2318	/	/	In the sweetness of whose behaviour, in the calmness of his mind, in the unbounded goodness of his heart, we have an evident Instance, what the true and the primitive unpassionate Religion was, before it was sowred by particular Factions
B2319	/	/	I thank God, that Dr. Wilkins was an Englishman, for whereever he had lived, there had been the chief Seat of generous Knowledge and true Philosophy
B2320	/	/	By the Advice of this Excellent man I first set upon this Enterprise, yet still came to it with much Reluctancy, because I was to follow the footsteps of so eminent a Person as Dr. Wren, who was the first that attempted any thing of this nature; whose original draughts do now make one of the Ornaments of that great Collection of Rarities in the Kings Closet. This Honor, which his first beginnings of this kind have receiv’d, to be admitted into the most famous place of the world, did not so much incourage, as the hazard of coming after Dr. Wren did affright me; for of him I must affirm, that, since the time of Archimedes, there scarce ever met in one man, in so great a perfection, such a Mechanical Hand, and so Philosophical a Mind.  But at last, being assured both by Dr. Wilkins, and Dr. Wren himself, that he had given over his intentions of prosecuting it, and not finding that there was any else design’d the pursuing of it, I set upon this undertaking, and was not a little incourag’d to proceed in it, by the Honour the Royal Society was pleas’d to favour me with, in approving of those draughts (which from time to time as I had an opportunity of describing) I presented to them. And particularly by the Incitements of divers of those Noble and excellent Persons of it, which were my more especial Friends, who were not less urgent with me for the publishing, then for the prosecution of them.  After I had almost compleated these Pictures and Observations (having had divers of them engraven, and was ready to send them to the Press) I was inform’d, that the Ingenious Physitian Dr. Henry Power had made several Microscopical Observations, which had I not afterwards, upon our interchangably viewing each others Papers, found that they were for the most part differing from mine, either in the Subject it self, or in the particulars taken notice of; and that his design was only to print Observations without Pictures, I had even then suppressed what I had so far proceeded in. But being further excited by several of my Friends, in compliance with their opinions, that it would not be unacceptable to several inquisitive Men, and hoping also, that I should thereby discover something New to the World, I have at length cast in my Mite, into the vast Treasury of A Philosophical History. And it is my hope, as well as belief, that these my Labours will be no more comparable to the Productions of many other Natural Philosophers, who are now every where busie about greater things; then my little Objects are to be compar’d to the greater and more beautiful Works of Nature, A Flea, a Mite, a Gnat, to an Horse, an Elephant, or a Lyon.

B2601	/	/	The king promised to do this
B2603	/	/	Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me
B2604	/	/	Of course the poor child is sick, answered the maid. She is always kept inside never gets any fresh air. Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me. Those few steps will bring her back to health.
B2605	/	/	Just what does the girl have that makes her so ill? asked the mother. Of course the poor child is sick, answered the maid. She is always kept inside never gets any fresh air. Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me. Those few steps will bring her back to health. The mother agreed to this, and the next morning the maid and the daughter left for the fair.
B2606	/	/	He gave the faithful maid so much money that she was able to move to a different country with her entire family.
B2609	/	/	Mother, dear, I must go away. I entrust my dear wife to you.

B2635	/	/	From this dedication learn my love for proclaiming the truth
B2636	/	/	WHEN MANY PEOPLE asked my opinion about Galileo's Sidereal Messenger, I decided to satisfy them all by adopting the short cut of circulating in printed form the letter which I sent to Galileo
B2637	/	/	Whereas most debaters get all heated up, I regard humor as a more pleasant tone in discussions. Other authors strive for impressiveness in the exposition of philosophy by the weightiness of their assertions; yet they often prove amusing, unintentionally. I seem by nature cut out to lighten the hard work and difficulty of a subject by mental relaxation, conveyed by the style.
B2638	/	/	people in the academic world need not be reminded (let others at least imagine) what it means to defend one's position. When a debater does so, he adopts as his own not only true and traditional views but also absurdities and falsities (in the schools frequently, godless, baneful, and blasphemous beliefs as well). He professes, according to the exigencies of his speech, either that he favors these ideas, or accepts them, upholds them, proves them, or will prove them. Yet at heart he believes nothing less, his motive being merely to give his opponent practice in defending the truth. Hence a disputation becomes more entertaining if an unsophisticated speaker is debarred from the truth as his position by being unexpectedly assigned a contrary thesis, and by being ordered to defend what he never thought would have to be defended.
B2640	/	/	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said. I have never belittled or laid false claim to the ideas of others, when I had none of my own. I have never fawned on others, nor have I been self-effacing if I made some better or prior discovery by my own exertions.
B2641	/	/	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said.
B2642	/	/	Yet let no one assume that by my readiness to agree with Galileo I propose to deprive others of their right to disagree with him.
B2644	/	/	I supposed that among others Galileo too, the most highly qualified of all, would discuss with me by mail the new kind of astronomy or celestial physics which I had published, and that he would resume our interrupted correspondence, which had begun twelve years before
B2645	/	/	I swear to reject them without reservation, as soon as any better informed person points out an error to me by a sound method.
B2647	/	/	men of the highest reputation, raised by their erudition, seriousness, and steadfastness far above the unreliability of ordinary people, were transmitting these messages about Galileo
B2648	/	/	I was influenced most by Galileo's prestige, achieved by the soundness of his judgment and the subtlety of his mind.
B2649	/	/	I behold great and most marvelous sights proposed to philosophers and astronomers, including myself, if I am not mistaken; I behold all lovers of true philosophy summoned to the commencement of great observation.
B2650	/	/	I craved to plunge into the subject, inasmuch as I was invited; and since I had written on the same topic six years before, I yearned to discuss with you, most accomplished Galileo, in a highly agreeable kind of discourse, the many undisclosed treasures of Jehovah the creator, which He reveals to us one after another. For who is permitted to remain silent at the news of such momentous developments? Who is not filled with a surging love of God, pouring itself copiously forth through tongue and pen?

Does he not make his writings public, and could he possibly hide any villainy that might be perpetrated? Shall I disparage him, a gentleman of Florence, for the things he has seen? Shall I with my poor vision disparage him with his keen sight? Shall he with his equipment of optical instruments be disparaged by me, who must use my naked eyes because I lack these aids? Shall I not have confidence in him, when he invites everybody to see the same sights, and what is of supreme importance, even offers his own instrument in order to gain support on the strength of observations?
B2666	/	/	Why is it that I find part of the book verified by my own experience and also by the affirmations of others?
B2668	/	/	Their conclusions agree with the highly illuminating observations which you report on the same subject. Consequently I have no basis for questioning the rest of your book and the four satellites of Jupiter.
B2669	/	/	I shall discuss with you, Galileo, things which are absolutely certain and which may be seen, I confidently hope, with my own eyes.
B2671	/	/	But here I am trying to induce the skeptical to have faith in your instrument.
B2673	/	/	by your discoveries you caused the sun of truth to rise
B2674	/	/	Putting aside all misgivings, you turned directly to visual experimentation.
B2676	/	/	These are the conditions, I say, which I shall observe in setting up the convex lens, for the purpose of magnifying objects in the field of vision. I shall place the eye not far from the spot where the rays from all points of the object under observation converge at a common focus (this is the function of the hyperbolic nipple). The hyperbola will be extended so far that a ray from this point or center will make an angle of 27° with the tangent at the edge of the hyperbola, and will therefore be refracted about 9°. Thus I shall have at either edge a refraction of about 30 1/2°, but proportionally less in between.  Now the rays from a single point of an object shining so far away come down to the nipple practically parallel. Thereafter they converge and enter the crystalline lens of the eye. Being refracted by the crystalline lens, they meet at a point close behind it. Then they diverge again until, spreading out as though from the tip of a pencil, they strike the retina. Thus from every point on the moon light falls on a separate area of the retina, so that the image becomes quite confused. Therefore I shall adapt a concave lens to the individual eye of each observer in accordance with the variations in their vision. In this way the convergence of the rays from any one point will be stopped by a refraction in the opposite direction accomplished by the concave lens. The rays will diverge instead, and will enter the crystalline lens as though they were coming from some nearby point. After being refracted by the crystalline lens, they will find their points of convergence on the retina itself. This is the definition of clear vision.
B2679	/	/	Under your guidance I recognize that the celestial substance is incredibly tenuous.
B2680	/	/	if fate smiles on me so that I can overcome the obstacles and attempt the mechanical construction, I shall exert myself energetically in that endeavor, pursuing alternative courses. On the one hand, I shall increase the number of lenses. They will have on either side perfectly spherical surfaces of very slight curvature. I shall place them at fixed intervals in the tube, the outer lenses being a little wider. Even so, the eye will be located within the limits of the area where parallel rays passing through all the lenses converge; with regard to these limits, see pages 190 and 440 of my “Optics.” On the other hand, to enable me more easily to correct the aberration (should there be any) in a single surface, I shall design a lens shaped like a nipple, to be used by itself. One of its surfaces will be practically plane, because its curvature will amount to only 1/2 or 30’ of a spherically convex shell. The other surface, which is directed toward the eye, will not be spherical. My intention is to avoid what is illustrated by the diagram on page 194, namely, distortion and confusion of the parts of the object under observation, the subject treated in Proposition 18 on page 193. Instead, the second surface will take the shape of a nipple, as shown in the diagram on page 198. Hence it will resemble the crystalline lens of the eye, because it will be bounded by the curvature of a hyperbolic line. This is the figure which I sought in the diagram on page 106 for the sake of optical devices, as indicated on pages 96 and 109. The aim is to achieve undistorted vision, in which the images of the parts of the object under observation are enlarged proportionally, as set forth on page 105.
B2681	/	/	you have certainly discovered an ingenious method of ascertaining to what extent objects are magnified by your instrument, and how individual minutes and fractions of minutes can be discerned in the heavens
B2682	/	/	Johannes Pistorius, asked me more than once, I recall, whether Brahe’s observations were so refined that in my opinion absolutely nothing could be lacking in them. I vigorously maintained that the pinnacle had been reached, and that nothing further was left to human enterprise, because the eyes would not permit greater precision, nor would the effect of refraction, which alters the position of the stars with reference to the horizon. In rebuttal, he steadfastly declared that some day somebody would come along who would devise a more exact procedure with the help of lenses. I objected on the ground that their refractive properties made lenses unsuitable for reliable observations. But now at last I see that Pistorius was in part a true prophet. To be sure, Brahe's observations speak for themselves and need no praise. For what an arc of 60° is in the heavens, or 34’, is known through Brahe instruments by themselves. But whereas Brahe in this way measured celestial degrees in the heavens (or even I determined the diameter of the moon by my optical device), now your telescope, Galileo, surpasses these attainments. Accepting the numerical results recorded by Brahe and me, it subdivides them with the utmost nicety into minutes and fractions of minutes. It couples itself with Brahe's observational method in a most appropriate marriage, so that Brahe has good reason to rejoice at your method of observation, and you must base your method on Brahe’s.
B2683	/	/	Would you like me to express my feelings? I want your instrument for the study of lunar eclipses, in the hope that it may furnish the most extraordinary aid in improving and where necessary in recasting, the whole of my “Hipparchus” or demonstration of the sizes and distances of the three bodies, sun, moon, and earth. For the variations in the solar and lunar diameters, and the portion of the moon that is eclipsed, will be measured with precision only by the man who is equipped with your telescope and acquires skill in observing.
B2685	/	/	Therefore let Galileo take his stand by Kepler's side. Let the former observe the moon with his face turned skyward, while the latter studies the sun by looking down at a screen (lest the lens injure his eye). Let each employ his own device, and from this partnership may there some day arise an absolutely perfect theory of the distances.
B2688	/	/	If a comet appears, it will be possible to make highly accurate observations of its parallax (like the moon's) by comparison with those quite minute and very numerous stars which are visible only through your instrument. From the parallax measurements we may draw more definite conclusions than we have ever had before about the height of comets.

B2691	/	/	it occurs to me to compete with you in scrutinizing those small spots first noticed by you in the brighter region. Yet, if this is agreed upon, I hope to get results by my own method of observation, with my back to the moon. I shall admit the light of the moon through an aperture to a sheet of paper mounted on a rod. The aperture will be fitted with a crystal lens curving spherically from a circular edge. The paper will be adjusted to the focus of the rays. In this way, with a rod 12 feet long, a perfect image of the body of the moon will be obtained the size of a large silver coin.
B2692	/	/	The paper will be adjusted to the focus of the rays. In this way, with a rod 12 feet long, a perfect image of the body of the moon will be obtained the size of a large silver coin.
B2693	/	/	I explained the device in Proposition 23 on page 196 of my book, and on page 211.
B2694	/	/	you begin your observations by specifying the age of the moon, and for the first time you point out the imperfections of the oval line in the crescent phase. In Number 8 on page 244 of my book I showed that the circle of illumination appears as an oval. What you say, then, is correct and in full accord with mathematics.
B2699	/	/	these suggestions (about cavities that are below the surface and not cut through the mountains) are not so weighty that I would deem them worthy of a stubborn defense, should they be rendered completely untenable by your subsequent reports.
B2703	/	/	But the flaw in my reasoning is indicated in the margin of the very next page. Obviously the river did not, like the land, shine by light received from the sun, but by light reflected from the illuminated air. Hence my analysis of the causes of the phenomenon was also unfortunate. For, in opposition to the doctrine of Aristotle's book On Colors, I asserted that water partakes of black less than earth does. Yet how could this be true, since earth turns darker when it is soaked with water? But why go on at length?
B2706	/	/	These very acute observations of yours do not lack the support of even my own testimony. For on page 248 of my Optics you have the half-moon divided by a wavy line. From this fact I deduced peaks and depressions in the body of the moon. On page 250 I describe the moon during an eclipse as looking like torn flesh or broken wood, with bright streaks penetrating into the region in shadow. On the basis of this observation I establish the conclusion, identical with yours, yet reached by a different sort of reasoning, that the parts of the moon are uneven, some being higher and others lower.
B2708	/	/	Pages 252 and 302 of my book could have told you about this air on the moon. These passages in my book are splendidly confirmed by your pertinent observations.
B2711	/	/	This situation would be consistent with my observations.
B2713	/	/	These were performed not only at night, when the explanation might be referred to the conditions of seeing, but also by day, when Venus disappears behind the part of the half-moon that is in shadow.
B2715	/	/	No less ingenious is your arrangement on page 14 inspecting the disk of the moon when its horns first emerge. You explain how to observe from behind a roof so that the horns are covered up and the rest of the disk becomes visible. This is an observational method very familiar to me.
B2716	/	/	There, adopting a procedure identical with yours, I too reject the same suppositions (that this light comes from the sun or from Venus), except that I treat the latter conjecture on its merits somewhat more favorably than you do.
B2717	/	/	You support my discussion of this redness on page 271 of the “Optics, where I derive it from the refraction of the sun's rays in our atmosphere. You also enhance the usefulness of what I said on page 301 by way of explaining why complete darkness does not always occur during a total eclipse of the sun; I repeated these remarks on page 117 in my book on the “New Star.”
B2718	/	/	I doubt, Galileo, whether the cause proposed by you can account for this redness. For this dawn-light, as you call it, surrounds the body of the moon much too uniformly to be the source of the redness, which is distributed so unevenly over the moon. This is shown by my observations, as reported on page 276. When you consider this subject in your System of the Universe, you will, I trust, advance a much more successful explanation of the causes of the phenomena under discussion.
B2719	/	/	I readily grant that, as compared with the celestial bodies in the vicinity of the sun, which I regarded on page 277 as the cause of the pale light, this dawn-light of yours serves as a better explanation.
B2720	/	/	When their small bodies are examined through the telescope, you say that they shrink in comparison with the diameter of the moon. You also mention other things, which truly produce a similar diminution of the stars, as I have known from long experience: twilight, daylight, a cloud, a veil, colored glass.
B2721	/	/	I should like to ask you, Galileo, whether you are satisfied with the reasons for this effect, as presented by me in my discussion of the process of vision on page 217 and especially on page 221 of my Optics. For if you find nothing amiss, you may hereafter discuss the matter correctly.
B2722	/	/	Point sources of light transmit their cones to the crystalline lens. There refraction takes place, and behind the lens the cones again contract to a point. But this point does not reach as far as the retina. Therefore the light is dispersed once more, and spreads over a small area of the retina, whereas it should impinge on a point. Hence the telescope, by introducing another refraction, makes this point coincide with the retina. It is not true, then, that some rays come down to the eye from the brightness enveloping the stars on the outside. On the contrary, the rays which come down from the shining body itself are scattered, as a result of refraction and the widening of the opening in the uvea at night. They brighten the area on the retina around the point which should represent the star. The telescope on earth does not remove anything from the stars in heaven, but it does take away from the retina whatever light is superfluous.
B2724	/	/	persons with unimpaired vision, using astronomical instruments that are not deceived by these wavy crowns, as is the naked eye, ascertain the dimensions of the stars' diameters in terms of minutes and fractions of minutes
B2725	/	/	You have a large number of eyewitnesses to the innumerability of the stars. The rabbis are said to enumerate more than 12,000. A clergyman of my acquaintance one moonless night counted over 40 in Orion's Shield. The larger stars in the Pleiades are arranged in order by Mästlin to the number of fourteen
B2726	/	/	You have conferred a blessing on astronomers and physicists by revealing the true character of the Milky Way, the nebulae, and the nebulous spirals. You have upheld those writers who long ago reached the same conclusion as you: they are nothing but a mass of stars, whose luminosities blend on account of the dullness of our eyes.  Accordingly, scientists will henceforth cease to create comets and new stars out of the Milky Way, after the manner of Brahe, lest they irrationally assert the passing away of perfect and eternal celestial bodies.
B2727	/	/	Accordingly, scientists will henceforth cease to create comets and new stars out of the Milky Way, after the manner of Brahe, lest they irrationally assert the passing away of perfect and eternal celestial bodies.
B2733	/	/	this will remain an open question until this phenomenon too is detected by someone equipped for marvelously refined observations
B2734	/	/	Therefore, for the sake of those who, as it were, will presently be on hand to attempt this voyage, let us establish the astronomy, Galileo, you of Jupiter, and me of the moon.
B2735	/	/	as soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying, settlers from our species of man will not be lacking. Who would once have thought that the crossing of the wide ocean was calmer and safer than of the narrow Adriatic Sea, Baltic Sea, or English Channel? Given ships or sails adapted to the breezes of heaven, there will be those who will not shrink from even that vast
B2736	/	/	as soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying, settlers from our species of man will not be lacking
B2738	/	/	I have also thought it worth while, in passing, to tweak the ear of the higher philosophy. Let it ponder the questions whether the almighty and provident Guardian of the human race permits anything useless and why, like an experienced steward, He opens the inner chambers of his building to us at this particular time. Such was the opinion put forward by my good friend Thomas Seget, a man of wide learning. Or does God the creator, as I replied, lead mankind, like some growing youngster gradually approaching maturity, step by step from one stage of knowledge to another?
B2739	/	/	does God the creator, as I replied, lead mankind, like some growing youngster gradually approaching maturity, step by step from one stage of knowledge to another?
B2740	/	/	Let the higher philosophy reflect, I repeat, and glance backward to some extent. How far has the knowledge of nature progressed, how much is left, and what may the men of the future expect?
B2741	/	/	We should not anticipate that all of us, equipped with your telescopes, Galileo, will observe them hereafter as a matter of course
B2746	/	/	 in the interests of that contemplation for which man was created, and adorned and equipped with eyes, he could not remain at rest in the center. On the contrary, he must make an annual journey on this boat, which is our earth, to perform his observations. So surveyors, in measuring inaccessible objects, move from place to place for the purpose of obtaining from the distance between their positions an accurate base line for the triangulation.
B2749	/	/	It remains for me to make an urgent request of you, most illustrious Galileo. Press on vigorously with your observations, and let us know at the very earliest opportunity what results your observations have attained
B2750	/	/	I promised to prepare something in time for the scheduled departure of the couriers, and I kept my pledge.
B2751	/	/	I resolved to advise the reader that everybody has his own preference
B2752	/	/	I have always followed the practice of praising what I deemed well said by others, and of refuting what was badly said
B2753	/	/	I have never belittled or laid false claim to the ideas of others, when I had none of my own.
B2754	/	/	I have never fawned on others, nor have I been self-effacing if I made some better or prior discovery by my own exertions.
B2755	/	/	I do not think that Galileo, an Italian, has treated me, a German, so well that in return I must flatter him, with injury to the truth or to my deepest convictions.
B2756	/	/	let no one assume that by my readiness to agree with Galileo I propose to deprive others of their right to disagree with him
B2757	/	/	all men are free to make up their own minds
B2759	/	/	I swear to reject them without reservation, as soon as any better informed person points out an error to me by a sound method

B2784	/	/	The next item in your little book is the ingenious and sound proof on page 13 of what I too mentioned casually on page 250, but failed to demonstrate

B2967	/	/	I have seen the entire castle, and I want to know what is in this room as well.
B2968	/	/	You must help me. The faithful servant thought to himself for a long time how to approach the matter, for it was difficult even to come into view of the king's daughter. Finally he thought of a way,

B2991	/	/	Oh, my most faithful Johannes, pardon! Pardon! Bring him down.
B2992	/	/	Oh, I have rewarded him very badly for his great loyalty.
B2993	/	/	This caused the king and the queen great grief,
B2994	/	/	Oh, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes.
B2995	/	/	For you I will give up everything I have in the world.
B2996	/	/	The king was horrified when he heard that he would have to kill his own dearest children, but he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty, and how he had died for him, then drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children's heads.
B2997	/	/	he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty
B2999	/	/	Your loyalty shall not go unrewarded,
B3000	/	/	Have you been praying in the church? Yes,
B3001	/	/	We owe it to him for his great loyalty.
B3003	/	/	God be praised!
B3004	/	/	Have faithful Johannes come to me.
B3005	/	/	Faithful Johannes was his favorite servant, and was so called, because he had been so loyal to him for his whole life long.
B3006	/	/	Most faithful Johannes, I feel that my end is near.
B3007	/	/	I will not be able to close my eyes in peace if you do not promise to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster father.
B3009	/	/	Then I will die in comfort and peace
B3011	/	/	After faithful Johannes had once more given his promise to the old king about this, the latter said no more, but laid his head on his pillow and died.
B3012	/	/	After the old king had been carried to his grave, faithful Johannes told the young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said, I will surely keep my promise, and will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him, even if it should cost me my life.
B3015	/	/	Faithful Johannes held him back, saying, I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber. It could bring great misfortune on you and on me.
B3018	/	/	You are my most faithful Johannes. You must help me.
B3019	/	/	The faithful servant thought to himself for a long time how to approach the matter, for it was difficult even to come into view of the king's daughter. Finally he thought of a way, and said to the king, Everything which she has about her is of gold -- tables, chairs, dishes, cups, bowls, and household implements. Among your treasures are five tons of gold. Have the royal goldsmiths fashion one ton into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts, and strange animals.

She will like these things, and we will go there with them and to try our luck.
B3021	/	/	The king summoned all the goldsmiths, and they had to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were prepared.
B3023	/	/	Faithful Johannes had the king stay behind on the ship and wait for him.
B3024	/	/	This made her all the more curious and desirous
B3028	/	/	I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are. If I have tricked you into coming with me, it is only because of my great love for you. The first time I saw your portrait, I fell to the ground unconscious.
B3030	/	/	But who knows that? And if anyone does know it, and tells it to the king, he will be turned to stone from his toes to his knees.
B3031	/	/	I know more than that. Even if the horse is killed, still the young king will not keep his bride.
B3033	/	/	If anyone knows it and tells it to the king, half his body will become stone, from his knees to his heart.
B3034	/	/	I know still more. Even if the wedding shirt is burned up, still the young king will not have his bride.
B3037	/	/	But the king said, Hold your peace and leave him alone. He is my most faithful Johannes. Who knows what good may come of this?
B3039	/	/	But the young king said, Who knows what good he may have done? Leave him alone. He is my most faithful Johannes.
B3044	/	/	The next morning faithful Johannes was condemned and led to the gallows. Standing high on the platform and about to be executed, he said, Everyone who is condemned to die is permitted before his end to say one last thing. May I too have this right? Yes, answered the king. You are granted this right.
B3046	/	/	Faithful Johannes said, I have been unjustly condemned, and have always been loyal to you, and he related how he had heard the conversation of the ravens at sea, and how he had had to do all these things in order to save his master.
B3049	/	/	Every time that he looked at it he wept, saying, Oh, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes.
B3050	/	/	when the queen was at church
B3051	/	/	The king cried, For you I will give up everything I have in the world.
B3052	/	/	He said to the king, Your loyalty shall not go unrewarded, then taking the children's heads, he put them on again, then rubbed the wounds with their blood, at which they became immediately whole again, and jumped about and went on playing as if nothing had happened.
B3053	/	/	When she entered, he said to her, Have you been praying in the church?
B3054	/	/	The queen turned pale, and her heart filled with terror, but she said, We owe it to him for his great loyalty.
B3056	/	/	Why do you never open this one for me?
B3057	/	/	The king answered I have seen the entire castle, and I want to know what is in this room as well. And he was about to break open the door by force.
B3058	/	/	If I do not go in, it will be my certain downfall. I shall have no rest day or night until I have seen inside with my own eyes. I shall not leave here until you have unlocked the door.
B3059	/	/	But what good did it do? The king stood on tiptoes and saw the portrait over faithful Johannes's shoulder.
B3060	/	/	The king summoned all the goldsmiths, and they had to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were prepared. When everything had been loaded on board a ship, faithful Johannes disguised himself as a merchant, and the king had to do the same thing in order to make himself quite unrecognizable. Then they sailed across the sea, and sailed on until they came to the city where the Princess of the Golden Roof lived.
B3061	/	/	Faithful Johannes had the king stay behind on the ship and wait for him. Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me, he said. Therefore see that everything is in order. Have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated.
B3062	/	/	She was just turning around to carry away the sparkling water when she saw the stranger and asked who he was. He answered, I am a merchant, opening his apron, and letting her look in.
B3066	/	/	I will not be able to close my eyes in peace if you do not promise to teach him everything that he ought to know
B3067	/	/	I want to know what is in this room as well.
B3068	/	/	Who knows what good may come of this?
B3069	/	/	Who knows what good he may have done?

B3077	/	/	Most faithful Johannes, I feel that my end is near. My only concern is for my son. He is still young and may not always have the best judgment. I will not be able to close my eyes in peace if you do not promise to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster father.
B3079	/	/	and will serve him faithfully
B3080	/	/	After my death, show him the entire castle -- all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the treasures which lie therein. But do not show him the last chamber in the long gallery, which contains the portrait of the Princess of the Golden Roof. If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, will fall down unconscious, and will put himself at great risk for her sake. You must protect him from that
B3082	/	/	I will not forsake him,
B3084	/	/	faithful Johannes told the young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed
B3085	/	/	and said, I will surely keep my promise, and will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him, even if it should cost me my life.
B3086	/	/	will be loyal to you as I have been loyal to him
B3088	/	/	It is now time for you to see your inheritance. I will show you your father's castle.
B3089	/	/	Then he took him everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches and the magnificent chambers
B3091	/	/	The young king noticed that faithful Johannes always walked past this one door, and said, Why do you never open this one for me? He replied, There is something in there that would frighten you. The king answered I have seen the entire castle, and I want to know what is in this room as well. And he was about to break open the door by force. Faithful Johannes held him back, saying, I promised your father before his death that you should not see inside this chamber. It could bring great misfortune on you and on me. Oh, no! replied the young king. If I do not go in, it will be my certain downfall. I shall have no rest day or night until I have seen inside with my own eyes. I shall not leave here until you have unlocked the door.
B3092	/	/	It could bring great misfortune on you and on me.
B3093	/	/	Faithful Johannes saw that there was no other way
B3096	/	/	fter seeing the girl's portrait, which was so magnificent and glistened with gold and precious stones, he fell unconscious to the ground.
B3097	/	/	Faithful Johannes picked him up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought, Misfortune has befallen us, dear Lord. How will it end? Then he strengthened the king with wine, until he regained consciousness.
B3098	/	/	The king's first words were, Oh, whose portrait is that beautiful picture? That is the Princess of the Golden Roof, answered faithful Johannes.
B3099	/	/	The king continued, My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they would not be able to express it. I will risk my life to win her. You are my most faithful Johannes. You must help me.
B3101	/	/	The faithful servant thought to himself for a long time how to approach the matter, for it was difficult even to come into view of the king's daughter.
B3102	/	/	Everything which she has about her is of gold -- tables, chairs, dishes, cups, bowls, and household implements. Among your treasures are five tons of gold. Have the royal goldsmiths fashion one ton into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts, and strange animals. She will like these things, and we will go there with them and to try our luck
B3104	/	/	Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me, he said. Therefore see that everything is in order. Have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated.
B3106	/	/	Oh, what beautiful golden things, she cried, putting her buckets down and looking at the golden wares one after the other. Then the girl said, The princess must see these things. She takes such great pleasure in golden things, that she will buy all you have.
B3112	/	/	But faithful Johannes remained with the helmsman and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying, Set all the sails and fly like a bird in the air.
B3113	/	/	Inside, the king showed her the golden vessels, every one of them, and also the wild beasts and strange animals
B3114	/	/	After she had looked at the last item, she thanked the merchant and wanted to go home,
B3117	/	/	Taking her by the hand, the king said, I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are.
B3118	/	/	Taking her by the hand, the king said, I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no lower birth than you are
B3121	/	/	Now it so happened that while they were sailing onward on the high sea, faithful Johannes, who was sitting at the front of the ship making music, saw three ravens flying through the air towards them
B3122	/	/	One cried Oh, he is carrying home the Princess of the Golden Roof. Yes, replied the second, but he doesn't have her yet. The third one said, Yes, he has her. She is sitting beside him in the ship. Then the first one began again, crying, What good will that do him? When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will leap up into the air with him, and he will never see his bride again. The second one spoke, Is there no escape? Oh, yes, if someone else quickly mounts it, takes the gun from its saddlebag, and shoots the horse dead, then young king will be rescued. But who knows that? And if anyone does know it, and tells it to the king, he will be turned to stone from his toes to his knees.
B3125	/	/	Then the second raven said, I know more than that. Even if the horse is killed, still the young king will not keep his bride. When they enter the castle together, a ready-made wedding shirt will be lying there on a platter. It will appear to be woven of gold and silver, but it is nothing but sulfur and pitch. If he puts it on, it will burn him to the very marrow and bone.
B3126	/	/	Oh, yes, replied the second raven. If anyone with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it up, the young king will be saved. But what good will that do? If anyone knows it and tells it to the king, half his body will become stone, from his knees to his heart.
B3127	/	/	If anyone with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it up, the young king will be saved. But what good will that do? If anyone knows it and tells it to the king, half his body will become stone, from his knees to his heart
B3128	/	/	When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will leap up into the air with him, and he will never see his bride again
B3129	/	/	if someone else quickly mounts it, takes the gun from its saddlebag, and shoots the horse dead, then young king will be rescued
B3130	/	/	I know more than that. Even if the horse is killed, still the young king will not keep his bride. When they enter the castle together, a ready-made wedding shirt will be lying there on a platter. It will appear to be woven of gold and silver, but it is nothing but sulfur and pitch. If he puts it on, it will burn him to the very marrow and bone.
B3131	/	/	I know still more. Even if the wedding shirt is burned up, still the young king will not have his bride. After the wedding, when the dancing begins and the young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead. If someone does not lift her up and draw three drops of blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows that reveals it, his entire body will turn to stone, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.
B3132	/	/	Then the third raven said, I know still more. Even if the wedding shirt is burned up, still the young king will not have his bride. After the wedding, when the dancing begins and the young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead. If someone does not lift her up and draw three drops of blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows that reveals it, his entire body will turn to stone, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.
B3134	/	/	From that time forth he became quiet and sad, for if he concealed what he had heard from his master, it would bring misfortune to the king, but if he revealed it to him, then he himself would have to sacrifice his life
B3136	/	/	When they landed, what the raven foretold did indeed happen
B3137	/	/	He was about to mount it when faithful Johannes pushed in front of him, quickly jumped onto the horse, drew the gun from its saddlebag, and shot the horse.
B3138	/	/	faithful Johannes pushed in front of him, quickly jumped onto the horse, drew the gun from its saddlebag, and shot the horse
B3140	/	/	faithful Johannes,
B3141	/	/	faithful Johannes pushed him away, seized it with gloves, carried it quickly to the fire, and burned it up.
B3142	/	/	pushed him away, seized it with gloves, carried it quickly to the fire, and burned it up
B3144	/	/	Faithful Johannes was watchful and looked into her face
B3146	/	/	He ran quickly to her, picked her up and carried her into a chamber. He laid her down, then knelt and sucked three drops of blood from her right breast, and spat them out. Immediately she breathed again and regained consciousness
B3148	/	/	faithful Johannes
B3151	/	/	Yes, answered the king. You are granted this right.
B3154	/	/	This caused the king and the queen great grief
B3155	/	/	I have rewarded him very badly for his great loyalty.
B3156	/	/	He then ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom next to his bed. Every time that he looked at it he wept, saying, Oh, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes.
B3158	/	/	, if only I could bring you back to life again, my most faithful Johannes.
B3159	/	/	Then the stone began to speak and said, You can bring me back to life again if you will in return give up what is dearest to you. The king cried, For you I will give up everything I have in the world. The stone continued, If you will cut off the heads of your two children with your own hand, then sprinkle their blood on me, I shall be restored to life.
B3160	/	/	The king was horrified when he heard that he would have to kill his own dearest children, but he thought of faithful Johannes's great loyalty, and how he had died for him, then drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children's heads. And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, it returned to life, and faithful Johannes stood before him, again healthy and well.
B3162	/	/	When he saw the queen coming he hid faithful Johannes and the two children in a large chest. When she entered, he said to her, Have you been praying in the church? Yes, she answered, but I have constantly been thinking about faithful Johannes and what misfortune has befallen him because of us.
B3163	/	/	but I have constantly been thinking about faithful Johannes and what misfortune has befallen him because of us.
B3165	/	/	, God be praised!
B3166	/	/	Faithful Johannes has been saved, and we have our little sons again as well.
B3167	/	/	Faithful Johannes has been saved,

B3203	/	/	she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off, and she cried and cried and could not be comforted.
B3205	/	/	Marlene stood by crying and crying
B3206	/	/	Here is the golden chain for you. Now sing that song again for me.
B3207	/	/	, if it belonged only to me, you should have it. Yes, said the others, if he sings again he can have it.
B3208	/	/	if it belonged only to me, you should have it. Yes, said the others, if he sings again he can have it.
B3210	/	/	With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully
B3211	/	/	Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks.
B3212	/	/	He threw the shoes down to her.
B3219	/	/	So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white scarf out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen
B3226	/	/	Marlene, why are you crying? Your brother will certainly come back.
B3229	/	/	Marlene, however, was as happy and contented as if her brother were still alive. And she went merrily into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.
B3230	/	/	My mother, she killed me, Then one of them stopped working. My father, he ate me, Then two more stopped working and listened, My sister Marlene, Then four more stopped, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Now only eight only were chiseling, Laid them beneath Now only five, the juniper tree, Now only one, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
B3233	/	/	My mother, she killed me, The mother stopped her ears and shut her eyes, not wanting to see or hear, but there was a roaring in her ears like the fiercest storm, and her eyes burned and flashed like lightning. My father, he ate me,
B3235	/	/	Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
B3237	/	/	My mother killed me. I wish I were a thousand fathoms beneath the earth, so I would not have to hear that! My father, he ate me, Then the woman fell down as if she were dead. My sister Marlene, Oh, said Marlene, I too will go out and see if the bird will give me something. Then she went out. Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, He threw the shoes down to her. Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
B3238	/	/	No, said the woman, jumping to her feet and with her hair standing up like flames of fire, I feel as if the world were coming to an end. I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better. And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death.
B3239	/	/	Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.
B3242	/	/	Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree
B3245	/	/	gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest.
B3247	/	/	Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,

B3273	/	/	aid that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen.
B3279	/	/	There was a little table with a white tablecloth and seven little plates, and each plate had a spoon, and there were seven knives and forks and seven mugs as well. Against the wall there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with snow-white sheets.
B3281	/	/	, If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want.
B3288	/	/	The dear child was dead, and she remained dead. They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days.
B3289	/	/	Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain, and one of them always stayed with it and watched over her.
B3291	/	/	We will not sell it for all the gold in the world.
B3293	/	/	the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him the coffin.
B3294	/	/	but let her continue to sleep there in the bed
B3295	/	/	The unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and let her do up the new lace
B3297	/	/	So she kept house for them. Every morning they went into the mountains looking for ore and gold, and in the evening when they came back home their meal had to be ready.
B3298	/	/	If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want
B3301	/	/	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? To this the mirror answered: You, my queen, are fairest of all.
B3302	/	/	for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.
B3306	/	/	until she had no peace day and night.
B3310	/	/	The poor child was now all alone in the great forest, and she was so afraid that she just looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do
B3311	/	/	Because she was so hungry and thirsty Snow-White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate, and from each mug she drank a drop of wine.
B3312	/	/	She remained lying in it, entrusted herself to God, and fell asleep.
B3313	/	/	Soon afterward she had a little daughter who was as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood, and therefore they called her Little Snow-White
B3314	/	/	They were so happy, that they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed
B3315	/	/	The next morning Snow-White woke up, and when she saw the seven dwarfs she was frightened. But they were friendly and asked, What is your name? My name is Snow-White, she answered.
B3317	/	/	Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  Who in this land is fairest of all? It answered: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.
B3318	/	/	You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White is a thousand times fairer than you.
B3319	/	/	This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie
B3321	/	/	At last she thought of something. Coloring her face, she disguised herself as an old peddler woman, so that no one would recognize her.
B3323	/	/	The mirror answered once again: You, my queen, are fair; it is true.  But Snow-White, beyond the mountains  With the seven dwarfs,  Is still a thousand times fairer than you.
B3325	/	/	When she heard that, all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow-White had come back to life.
B3326	/	/	Then with the art of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisoned comb. Then she disguised herself, taking the form of a different old woman.
B3328	/	/	The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door.
B3329	/	/	After they had agreed on the purchase

B3832	/	/	You see, citizens, you see the good fortune which this man owes tohis prudence, to his profound wisdom.  You see how, since he hasconcluded peace, he buys what is useful in the household and good toeat hot.
B3833	/	/	Oh, Peace! companion of fair Aphrodite and of the sweet Graces,how charming are thy features and yet I never knew it!  Would that Erosmight join me to thee, Eros, crowned with roses as Zeuxis112 shows him tous!
B3834	/	/	Women, children, have you not heard?  Faith! do you not heed theherald?  Quick! let the hares boil and roast merrily;

B3848	/	/	Let us save the ship of state, which just at present none seems able either to sail or row.
B3850	/	/	May the gods grant success to my plans!
B3857	/	/	I want all to have a share of everything and all property to be in common; there will no longer be either rich or poor; no longer shall we see one man harvesting vast tracts of land, while another has not ground enough to be buried in, nor one man surround himself with a whole army of slaves, while another has not a single attendant; I intend that there shall only be one and the same condition of life for all.
B3858	/	/	shall begin by making land, money, everything that is private property, common to all. Then we shall live on this common wealth, which we shall take care to administer with wise thrift.
B3859	/	/	The poor will no longer be obliged to work; each will have all that he needs, bread, salt fish, cakes, tunics, wine, chaplets and chick-pease;
B3860	/	/	The ugliest and the most flat-nosed will be side by side with the most charming, and to win the latter's favours, a man will first have to get into the former.
B3861	/	/	Athens will become nothing more than a single house, in which everything will belong to everyone; so that everybody will be able to go from one house to the other at pleasure.
B3882	/	/	besides, who will know better than a mother how to forward provisions to the front?
B3890	/	/	The Prytanes started the discussion of measures closely concerning the safety of the state; immediately, that blear-eyed fellow, the son of Neoclides, was the first to mount the platform. Then the folk shouted with their loudest voice, “What! he dares to speak, and that, too, when the safety of the state is concerned, and he a man who has not known how to save even his own eyebrows!”
B3892	/	/	Then he added that the women lend each other clothes, trinkets of gold and silver, drinking-cups, and not before witnesses too, but all by themselves, and that they return everything with exactitude without ever cheating each other;whereas, according to him, we are ever ready to deny the loans we have effected.
B3896	/	/	Blepyrus Ah! but I hate compulsion. Chremes But if it is for the public good, let us resign ourselves.
B3897	/	/	It's an old saying that our absurdest and maddest decrees always somehow turn out for our good.
B3899	/	/	Now tell us how we can be of service to you, so that we may show you our obedience, for we have never seen a cleverer woman than you.
B3902	/	/	There will be no more thieves, nor envious people, no more rags nor misery, no more abuse and no more prosecutions and law-suits.
B3903	/	/	Praxagora There will be no more thieves, nor envious people, no more rags nor misery, no more abuse and no more prosecutions and law-suits.
B3904	/	/	Devote the fecundity of your mind to the public weal; adorn the citizens' lives with a thousand enjoyments and teach them to seize every favourable opportunity. Devise some ingenious method to secure the much-needed salvation of Athens;
B3905	/	/	but let neither your acts nor your words recall anything of the past, for 'tis only innovations that please.
B3906	/	/	Praxagora I believe my ideas are good, but what I fear is that the public will cling to the old customs and refuse to accept my reforms. Blepyrus Have no fear about that. Love of novelty and disdain for traditions, these are the dominating principles among us.

B3912	/	/	Blepyrus There will be no more thieves then, eh? Praxagora Why steal, if you have a share of everything?
B3913	/	/	Even if you sleep outdoors there will be no more danger, for all will have the means of living. Besides, if anyone wanted to steal your cloak, you would give it to him yourself. Why not? You will only have to go to the common store and be given a better one.
B3918	/	/	The women have decreed that if a young man desires a young girl, he can only lay her after having satisfied an old woman; and if he refuses and goes to seek the maiden, the old women are authorized to seize him and drag him in.”
B3921	/	/	Happy are ye, who form choruses before our house!  Happy are ye, both neighbors and fellow-citizens! Happy am I myself! I am but a servant, and yet I have poured on my hair the most exquisite essences.  Let thanks be rendered to thee, Oh, Zeus!
B3922	/	/	Generously invite everyone and omit no one, old or young.  Dinner is ready for all; they need only go home.
B3923	/	/	If the lot has assigned my comedy to be played first of all, don't let that be a disadvantage to me; engrave in your memory all that shall have pleased you in it and judge the competitors equitably as you have bound yourselves by oath to do.
B3932	/	/	It is right and just for our sacred chorus  to advise and teach what's good for the city.  So first it seems best to us to equalize the citizens and take away their fears
B3933	/	/	And if anyone went astray, tripped by the wrestling moves  of Phrynichus, I say it should be possible for those who slipped up then to plead their cause and erase their previous mistakes.
B3934	/	/	But letting up on your anger, you who are wisest in nature, let's gladly make everyone our kinsman and full-fledged citizens too, who's ever fought for us at  sea.
B3938	/	/	“Persuasion has no other shrine save speech.”
B3939	/	/	They are my friends, and I won't judge them. For I will not be on hostile terms with either one. One I consider clever, the other I enjoy.
B3940	/	/	I came down here for a poet. For what purpose? So that the city might be saved to stage its choruses. So whichever of you will give the state some useful advice, that's the one I think I'll take.
B3944	/	/	If we distrusted those citizens in whom We now place confidence, and employed those we don't use now, we would be saved. If we now are suffering under the present circumstances, why wouldn't we be saved by doing the opposite?
B3945	/	/	When they consider the land of the enemy to be their own, and their own the enemy's, their ships a revenue, and their revenue a loss.
B3946	/	/	My tongue did swear, but Aeschylus I choose.
B3947	/	/	Dionysus By Zeus the Savior, I can't decide. For one has spoken cleverly, and the other one clearly. Now each of you once more tell me your opinion about the state, what plan you have to save her.
B3948	/	/	For this man of proven good sense will go back home again for the good of his citizens, for the good of his own relatives and friends, on account of being intelligent.
B3949	/	/	Well then, farewell, Aeschylus, go and save our city with noble sentiments, and educate the dunces.
B3960	/	/	Great the event, abundant the strife, grand the war that advances. So it's hard work to choose when one strains violently, while the other can twist around and bear down sharply.
B3962	/	/	So fear not, but scrutinize every topic, for the audience's sake at least, since they're so sophisticated.
B3963	/	/	Now is this not outrage and utter insolence, That I myself, Dionysos, son of Winejug, must walk, and let this fellow ride, so he might feel no pain and bear no burden?
B3982	/	/	Not him, by Zeus, but he kissed Aeschylus When he arrived, and shook his hand, And yielded the chair to him.
B3988	/	/	Come now, someone bring incense and fire, So I can pray before the show of wits to judge this contest most aesthetically.
B3991	/	/	For this was a democratic thing I did.
B3998	/	/	But if you're both afraid that our spectators lack a certain amount of knowledge, so as not to appreciate the fine points of what you say, don't worry about that, since that is no longer the case. For they are seasoned veterans and each one has a book and understands the clever stuff.
B4003	/	/	Blessed is the man having perfected intelligence.
B4006	/	/	First grant bon voyage to the departing poet as he rises to the light, ye spirits under the earth, and grant to the city good ideas for great gains. For we would then cease completely from these great woes and dire clashes in arms.
B4013	/	/	But if the women join us From Peloponnesus and Boeotia, then Hand in hand we'll rescue Greece.
B4014	/	/	Still, thought is free.... But if the women join us From Peloponnesus and Boeotia, then Hand in hand we'll rescue Greece.
B4015	/	/	No man will lift a lance against another—
B4019	/	/	O women, if we would compel the men To bow to Peace,
B4022	/	/	Peace maun be thought of first.
B4023	/	/	Love's lack except wi' makeshifts.... But let it be. Peace maun be thought of first.
B4027	/	/	For us I ha' no doubt. We can persuade Our men to strike a fair an' decent Peace,
B4028	/	/	We shall surprise the Acropolis today: That is the duty set the older dames.
B4029	/	/	Set out the terms in detail And we'll a' swear to them.
B4030	/	/	You, Calonice, repeat for the rest Each word I say. Then you must all take oath And pledge your arms to the same stern conditions—
B4033	/	/	Shall light a fear in us; we will come out To Peace alone.
B4041	/	/	I'm a free woman, I.
B4043	/	/	I'm coming of my own accord.... Why bars? It is not bars we need but common sense.
B4047	/	/	To take first the treasury out of your management, and so stop the war through the absence of gold.
B4049	/	/	But we abolish war straight by our policy.
B4054	/	/	Earth I could brave with laughter, Having such wonderful girls here to friend. O the daring, the gracious, the beautiful ones! Their courage unswerving and witty Will rescue our city.
B4056	/	/	Prepare for the battle, all. Gird up your angers. Our way the wind of sweet victory settles.
B4057	/	/	I think that perhaps then they'll give us our title— Peace-makers.
B4070	/	/	An oracle has promised Victory If we don't wrangle. Would you hear the words?
B4075	/	/	Then return to Sparta. Bid them Send envoys with full powers to treat of Peace; And I will urge the Senate here to choose Plenipotentiary ambassadors, As argument adducing this connection.
B4080	/	/	But come, these enmities let's quell. You stop from giving orders and I'll stop from doing wrong.
B4081	/	/	There's only one condition made (Indulge my whim in this I pray)— When Peace is signed once more, On no account am I to be repaid.
B4082	/	/	But on the contrary to promote good feeling in the state By word and deed. We've had enough calamities of late. So let a man or woman but divulge
B4083	/	/	Unless Peace is soon declared, we shall be driven In the void of women to try Cleisthenes.
B4088	/	/	I've never seen a nobler woman anywhere.
B4089	/	/	Now, brethren twined with mutual benefactions, Can you still war, can you suffer such disgrace? Why not be friends? What is there to prevent you?
B4090	/	/	There's no distinction in our politics: We've risen as one man to this conclusion;
B4091	/	/	Earth is delighted now, peace is the voice of earth.
B4092	/	/	Spartans, sort out your wives: Athenians, yours. Let each catch hands with his wife and dance his joy,
B4093	/	/	And all the Daimons summon hither to be Witnesses of our revelry And of the noble Peace we have made, Aphrodite our aid.
B4097	/	/	O Goddess, suffer not, I pray, this harsh deed to be done, But show us Greece and Athens with their warlike acts repealed!
B4100	/	/	All who inside Athens' walls have their dwelling into one great common basket we'll pack. Disenfranchised or citizens, allies or aliens, pell-mell the lot of them in we will squeeze. Till they discover humanity's meaning...
B4101	/	/	Each portion we'll take and wind in to this centre, inward to Athens each loyalty pull, Till from the vast heap where all's piled together at last can be woven a strong Cloak of State.
B4103	/	/	We come to treat o' Peace. ATHENIANS Well spoken there! And we the same. Let us callout Lysistrata Since she alone can settle the Peace-terms.
B4104	/	/	ATHENIANS I want to strip at once and plough my land. SPARTANS And mine I want to fertilize at once. LYSISTRATA And so you can, when Peace is once declared.
B4105	/	/	I agree with all of you. Now off, and cleanse yourselves for the Acropolis, For we invite you all in to a supper From our commissariat baskets.
B4107	/	/	When we are warm with wine, how wise we grow.
B4109	/	/	Come, Hunting Girl, an' hear my prayer— You whose arrows whizz in woodlands, come an' bless This Peace we swear.
B4110	/	/	Dance out his thanks, be grateful in music, And promise reformation with his heels.
B4111	/	/	That's only fair, since sober we're such fools:
B4112	/	/	Lead thou the dance, gather thy joyous tresses up i' bands An' play like a fawn. To madden them, clap thy hands, And sing praise to the warrior goddess templed i' our lands, Her o' the House o' Brass.
B4113	/	/	Let us be fenced wi' age long amity, O let this bond stick ever firm through thee In friendly happiness.
B4115	/	/	The women have appropriated the citadel. So, Lampito, dash off to your own land And raise the rebels there.
B4123	/	/	Now will you help me, if I find a means To stamp the war out.
B4124	/	/	And half is hackt off as the price of peace.
B4125	/	/	And I too! Why, to get a peep at the shy thing I'd clamber up to the tip-top o' Taygetus.
B4130	/	/	But, hardy Spartan, if you join with me All may be righted yet. O help me, help me.
B4131	/	/	But let it be. Peace maun be thought of first.
B4132	/	/	My friend, my friend! The only one amid this herd of weaklings.
B4136	/	/	SO, grasp the brim, you, Lampito, and all. You, Calonice, repeat for the rest Each word I say. Then you must all take oath And pledge your arms to the same stern conditions—
B4137	/	/	Do you all swear to this? MYRRHINE We do, we do. LYSISTRATA Then I shall immolate the victim thus. She drinks.
B4138	/	/	As I told you, The women have appropriated the citadel.
B4145	/	/	On, gallant allies of our high design, Vendors of grain-eggs-pulse-and-vegetables, Ye garlic-tavern-keepers of bakeries, Strike, batter, knock, hit, slap, and scratch our foes, Be finely imprudent, say what you think of them....
B4147	/	/	Still if you wake a wasps' nest then of wasps you must beware.
B4148	/	/	If you should do the same again, I'll punch you in the eye.
B4156	/	/	In our comradely venture Each taking her due part.
B4157	/	/	soon you will find that the War has an end.
B4158	/	/	So to untangle the War and its errors, ambassadors out on all sides we will send This way and that, here, there and round about
B4160	/	/	Through the whole city for all greasy fellows; burrs too, the parasites, off we will rub. That verminous plague of insensate place-seekers soon between thumb and forefinger we'll crack.
B4165	/	/	Every silly old-man threat While Lampito's with me. Or dear Ismenia, the noble Theban girl.
B4170	/	/	Not till a treaty finishes the war.
B4171	/	/	With sympathy your case I view;
B4176	/	/	There's only one condition made (Indulge my whim in this I pray)— When Peace is signed once more
B4181	/	/	I want to strip at once and plough my land. SPARTANS And mine I want to fertilize at once. LYSISTRATA And so you can, when Peace is once declared
B4183	/	/	Let each catch hands with his wife and dance his joy, Dance out his thanks, be grateful in music

B4185	/	/	And promise reformation with his heels.
B4189	/	/	the price of peace.
B4194	/	/	Well if you must have it so, we'll all agree.
B4195	/	/	Do you all swear to this?
B4196	/	/	We do, we do.
B4197	/	/	Greece and Athens with their warlike acts repealed!
B4199	/	/	It is not bars we need but common sense.
B4201	/	/	f you should do the same again, I'll punch you in the eye.
B4210	/	/	Bid them Send envoys with full powers to treat of Peace;
B4212	/	/	We come to treat o' Peace.
B4213	/	/	Well spoken there! And we the same. Let us callout Lysistrata Since she alone can settle the Peace-terms.
B4215	/	/	And so you can, when Peace is once declared.
B4216	/	/	And of the noble Peace we have made,
B4217	/	/	Happy Hera, Queen of all, And all the Daimons summon hither to be Witnesses of our revelry And of the noble Peace we have made, Aphrodite our aid.
B4218	/	/	Oh! Zeus, what art thou going to do for our people? Dost thou not see this, that our cities will soon be but empty husks?
B4219	/	/	I want to ask him what he reckons to do for all the Greeks. First Servant And if he doesn't tell you? Trygaeus I shall pursue him at law as a traitor who sells Greece to the Medes.
B4220	/	/	You hurt me too sorely, my daughters, when you ask me for bread, calling me your daddy, and there is not the ghost of an obolus in the house; if I succeed and come back, you will have a barley loaf every morning —and a punch in the eye for sauce!
B4225	/	/	Oh, what misery the very sight of War causes me! This then is the foe from whom I fly, who is so cruel, so formidable, so stalwart, so solid on his legs!
B4226	/	/	See the danger that threatens if he returns with the pestle, for War will quietly amuse himself with pounding all the towns of Hellas to pieces.
B4227	/	/	Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when freed of quarrels and fighting, we should rescue sweet Peace and draw her out of this pit, before some other pestle prevents us
B4228	/	/	Come, laborers, merchants, workmen, artisans, strangers,  whether you be domiciled or not, islanders— Come here, Greeks of all countries, come hurrying here with picks and levers and ropes!This is the moment to drain a cup in honor of the Good Genius.
B4230	/	/	All peoples of Greece, now is the time or never, for you to help each other. You see yourselves freed from battles and all their horrors of bloodshed.
B4232	/	/	Once we have hold of her, none in the world will be able to take her from us.
B4233	/	/	I am so happy, so delighted at not having to carry my buckler any more. I fart for joy and I laugh more than if I had cast my old age, as a serpent does its skin.
B4234	/	/	But when you have got the goddess, Then rejoice, shout and laugh; thenceforward you will be able to sail or stay at home, to make love or sleep, to attend festivals and processions, to play at cottabos, live like true Sybarites and to shout, Io, io!
B4235	/	/	Ah! God grant we may see the blessed day. I have suffered so much; have so oft slept with Phormio on hard beds. You will no longer find me a bitter and angry judge, nor, naturally, hard in my ways, as heretofore, but turned indulgent and grown younger by twenty years through happiness. We have been killing ourselves long enough, tiring ourselves out with going to the Lyceum and returning laden with spear and buckler.
B4236	/	/	Be not pitiless toward our prayers; permit us to deliver the goddess. Oh! the most human, the most generous of the gods, be favourable toward us, if it be true that you detest the haughty crests and proud brows of Pisander; we shall never cease, oh master, offering you sacred victims and solemn prayers.
B4237	/	/	Because it is to you that we sacrifice, whereas the barbarians worship them; hence they would like to see you destroyed, that they alone might receive the offerings.
B4238	/	/	So therefore, Hermes, my friend, help us with your whole heart to find and deliver the captive and we will celebrate the great Panathenaea in your honor as well as all the festivals of the other gods; for Hermes shall be the Mysteries, the Dipolia, the Adonia; everywhere the towns, freed from their miseries, will sacrifice to Hermes the Liberator;
B4239	/	/	Come, come, there is no working together. Come! all pull at the same instant!
B4240	/	/	Come! all together! Everyone to the work and with a good heart for the business.
B4242	/	/	Come then, all together! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! All together!
B4243	/	/	Chorus Come then, all together! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! All together! Peace is drawn out of the pit. With her come Opora and Theoria.
B4244	/	/	Ah! venerated goddess, who givest us our grapes, where am I to find the ten-thousand-gallon words wherewith to greet thee? I have none such at home. Oh! hail to thee, Opora, and thee, Theoria! How beautiful is thy face! How sweet thy breath! What gentle fragrance comes from thy bosom, gentle as freedom from military duty, as the most dainty perfumes!
B4245	/	/	Let the husbandmen take their farming tools and return to their fields as quickly as possible, but without either sword, spear or javelin. All is as quiet as if Peace had been reigning for a century.
B4246	/	/	Oh, thou, whom men of standing desired and who art good to husbandmen, I have gazed upon thee with delight; and now I go to greet my vines, to caress after so long an absence the fig trees I planted in my youth.
B4247	/	/	Friends, do you remember the happy life that Peace afforded us formerly; can you recall the splendid baskets of figs, both fresh and dried, the myrtles, the sweet wine, the violets blooming near the spring, and the olives, for which we have wept so much? Worship, adore the goddess for restoring you so many blessings.
B4250	/	/	Come, who wishes to take the charge of her? No one? Come, Theoria, I am going to lead you into the midst of the spectators and confide you to their care.
B4252	/	/	How everything succeeds to our wish, when the gods are willing and Fortune favours us! how opportunely everything falls out.
B4253	/	/	Oh! Peace, mighty queen, venerated goddess, thou, who presidest over choruses and at nuptials, deign to accept the sacrifices we offer thee.
B4254	/	/	Put an end to this tittle-tattle, to this idle babble, that set us defying one another. Cause the Greeks once more to taste the pleasant beverage of friendship and temper all hearts with the gentle feeling of forgiveness.
B4255	/	/	Oh! joy, joy! no more helmet, no more cheese nor onions!No, I have no passion for battles; what I love is to drink with good comrades in the corner by the fire when good dry wood, cut in the height of the summer, is crackling; it is to cook pease on the coals and beechnuts among the embers, it is to kiss our pretty Thracian while my wife is at the bath.
B4258	/	/	As for me, I will explain the matter to you all, children, youths, grown-ups and old men, aye, even to the decrepit dotards.
B4260	/	/	“Ah! Zeus,” he cries, “what are thy intentions? Lay aside thy besom; do not sweep Greece away!” Ah! Hush, hush! I think I hear his voice!
B4267	/	/	If there be a citizen, greedy for military rank and honors, who refuses, oh, divine Peace! to restore you to daylight— Chorus May he behave as cowardly as Cleonymus on the battlefield.
B4271	/	/	Hail! hail! thou beloved divinity! thy return overwhelms us with joy. When far from thee, my ardent wish to see my fields again made me pine with regret. From thee came all blessings. Oh! much desired Peace! thou art the sole support of those who spend their lives tilling the earth.
B4272	/	/	She says, that after the affair of Pylos she came to you unbidden to bring you a basket full of truces and that you thrice repulsed her by your votes in the assembly. Trygaeus Yes, we did wrong, but forgive us, for our mind was then entirely absorbed in leather.
B4273	/	/	Undoubtedly the comic poet who mounted the stage to praise himself in the parabasis would deserve to be handed over to the sticks of the beadles. Nevertheless, oh Muse, if it be right to esteem the most honest and illustrious of our comic writers at his proper value, permit our poet to say that he thinks he has deserved a glorious renown.
B4285	/	/	Don't talk, for it is divine Peace to whom we are sacrificing.
B4288	/	/	Trygaeus Then what should be done? Not to stop War would be to leave it to the decision of chance which of the two people should suffer the most, whereas by uniting under a treaty, we share the empire of Greece.
B4289	/	/	Wise Homer has also said: “He who delights in the horrors of civil war has neither country nor laws nor home.” What noble words!
B4290	/	/	And all of you, who yesterday were dying of hunger, come, stuff yourselves with this fine hare-stew; it's not every day that we find cakes lying neglected.Eat, eat, or I predict you will soon regret it.
B4291	/	/	But come, comrades, we who are in the first row, let us pick up the bridegroom and carry him in triumph.
B4292	/	/	Chorus Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus! Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!  Trygaeus Hail, hail, my friends. All who come with me shall have cakes galore.
B4293	/	/	Oh! thrice happy man, who so well deserve your good fortune!
B4294	/	/	You, who remain to the feast, it's your duty to devour dish after dish and not to ply empty jaws. Come, put heart into the work and eat with your mouths full. For, believe me, poor friends, white teeth are useless furniture if they chew nothing.
B4298	/	/	But the god, Apollo,in tragic style  whose oracles the Pythian priestess on her golden tripod makes known to us, deserves my censure, for surely he is a physician and a cunning diviner;
B4318	/	/	moderation is the strong point in my character. I love saving as much as anybody, and I know how to spend, when it's needed.
B4320	/	/	My master is going to drag you all out of the stupid, sapless life you are leading and ensure you one full of all delights.
B4321	/	/	Friends, it's Plutus whom my master brings, Plutus, who will give you riches.
B4324	/	/	But I have thought the matter well over, and the best thing is to make Plutus lie in the Temple of Asclepius. Blepsidemus Unquestionably that's the very best thing. Hurry and lead him away to the temple.
B4326	/	/	My arm shall destroy you, you infamous beings! Such an attempt is not to be borne; neither man nor god has ever dared the like. You shall die!
B4327	/	/	Poverty I am one that will punish you this very day for having wanted to make me disappear from here.
B4331	/	/	It is right that the good should be happy, that the wicked and the impious, on the other hand, should be miserable; that is a truth, I believe, which no one will gainsay. To realize this condition of things is a proposal as great as it is noble and useful in every respect, and we have found a means of attaining the object of our wishes. If Plutus recovers his sight and ceases from wandering about unseeing and at random, he will go to seek the just men and never leave them again; he will shun the perverse and ungodly; so, thanks to him, all men will become honest, rich and pious. Can anything better be conceived for the public weal?

B4336	/	/	Let Plutus recover his sight and divide his favours out equally to all, and none will ply either trade or art any longer; all toil would be done away with.
B4339	/	/	The poor man lives thriftily and attentive to his work; he has not got too much, but he does not lack what he really needs.
B4345	/	/	What joy for my master and even more for Plutus! The god has regained his sight; his eyes sparkle with the greatest brilliancy, thanks to the benevolent care of Asclepius.
B4346	/	/	I will sing to the honor of Asclepius, the son of illustrious Zeus, with a resounding voice; he is the beneficent star which men adore.
B4347	/	/	Neoclides shrieked, howled, sprang towards the foot of his bed and wanted to bolt, but the god laughed and said to him, “Keep where you are with your salve; by doing this you will not go and perjure yourself before the Assembly.”
B4348	/	/	As for myself, I did not cease thanking the god who had so quickly restored to Plutus his sight and had made Neoclides blinder than ever.
B4349	/	/	The rich, whose wealth is ill-gotten, are knitting their brows and shooting at him looks of fierce hate, while the just folk, who led a wretched existence, embrace him and grasp his hand in the transport of their joy;

B4353	/	/	How pleasant it is, friends, to live well, especially when it costs nothing!  What a deluge of blessings flood our household, and that too without our having wronged a single soul!  [Ah! what a delightful thing is wealth!
B4354	/	/	My father had left me a fairly decent fortune, and I helped those of my friends who were in want; it was, to my thinking, the most useful thing I could do with my fortune.
B4363	/	/	Plutus Zeus inflicted it on me, because of his jealousy of mankind. When I was young, I threatened him that I would only go to the just, the wise, the men of ordered life; to prevent my distinguishing these, he struck me with blindness! so much does he envy the good!
B4365	/	/	My master is going to drag you all out of the stupid, sapless life you are leading and ensure you one full of all delights. Leader of the Chorus
B4366	/	/	I will no longer conceal the truth from you. Friends, it's Plutus whom my master brings, Plutus, who will give you riches.

B4369	/	/	Agathon's Chorus I do honor to the divine Leto and to the lyre, the mother of songsof male and noble strains. The eyes of the goddess sparkle while listening to our enthusiastic chants. Honor to the powerful Phoebus! Hail! blessed son of Leto.

B4381	/	/	Let us ask the fulfillment of these wishes both for the city and for the people, and may the wisest of us cause her opinion to be accepted.

Heaven itself will punish sacrilege; being aflame with fury and mad with frenzy, all their deeds will prove to mortals, both men and women, that the deity punishes injustice and impiety, and that she is not slow to strike.
B4394	/	/	There are many reproaches we have the right to bring against men. The most serious is this, that the woman, who has given birth to a useful citizen, whether taxiarch or strategus should receive some distinction; a place of honor should be reserved for her at the Stenia, the Scirophoria,and the other festivals that we keep.
B4395	/	/	On the other hand, she of whom a coward was born or a worthless man, a bad trierarch or an unskilful pilot, should sit with shaven head, behind her sister who had borne a brave man.
B4397	/	/	Women, if you will be reconciled with me, I am willing, and I undertake never to say anything ill of you in future. Those are my proposals for peace.
B4398	/	/	This unfortunate man, who is chained to the post, is my father-in-law; if you will restore him to me, you will have no more cause to complain of me; but if not, I shall reveal your pranks to your husbands when they return from the war.

B4412	/	/	No more shall I your daughter share your bondage
B4413	/	/	For your unhappiness I weep with plaintive wail, mother
B4414	/	/	Even in adversity it is wise to yield to reason's dictates
B4417	/	/	Are not you then playing a sorry part to plot against me thus, after the kind treatment you by your own confession received from me, showing me no gratitude but all the ill you can? A thankless race! all you who covet honor from the mob  for your oratory. Oh that you were unknown to me! you who harm your friends and think no more of it, if you can say a word to win the mob. But tell me, what kind of cleverness did they think it, when against this child they passed their bloody vote?  Was it duty that led them to slay a human victim at the tomb, where sacrifice of oxen is more fitting? or does Achilles, if claiming the lives of those who slew him as his recompense, show his justice by marking her out for death? No! she at least never injured him.  He should have demanded Helen as a victim at his tomb, for she it was that proved his ruin, bringing him to Troy; or if some captive of surpassing beauty was to be singled out for death, this did not point to us; for the daughter of Tyndareus was fairest of all,  and her injury to him was proved no less than ours. Against the justice of his plea I pit this argument.
B4421	/	/	Human nature is not so stony-hearted as to hear your plaintive tale and catalogue of sorrows, without shedding a tear.
B4437	/	/	O dreadful crime! O deed without a name! beyond wonder!  impious! intolerable! Where are the laws between guest and host? Accursed of men! how have you mangled his flesh, slashing the poor child's limbs  with ruthless sword, lost to all sense of pity!
B4439	/	/	but, if otherwise, help me to punish  this most godless host, fearless alike of gods in heaven or hell, who has done a most unholy deed; who, though often he had shared my board and been counted first of all my guest-friends  meeting with every kindness he could claim—. And receiving my consideration, he slew my son, and bent though he was on murder, did not think it right to bury him, but cast his body forth to sea.
B4441	/	/	Now if this principle, when referred to you, is to be set at nothing, and they are to escape punishment who murder guests or dare to plunder the temples of gods,  then all fairness in human matters is at an end.
B4442	/	/	Why, oh! why do we mortals toil, as we must, and seek out all other sciences,  but Persuasion, the only real mistress of mankind, we take no further pains to master completely by offering to pay for the knowledge, so that any man could convince his fellows as he pleased and gain his point at once?
B4443	/	/	For it is always a good man's duty to help the right,  and to punish evil-doers wherever found.
B4446	/	/	this is the interest alike of citizen and state, that the wrong-doer be punished and the good man prosper
B4448	/	/	For the rights of justice and of the gods do not fall together;  there is ruin full of death and doom.

B4452	/	/	Never ought words to have outweighed deeds in this world, Agamemnon. No! if a man's deeds were good, so should his words have been;  if, on the other hand, evil, his words should have been unsound, instead of its being possible at times to speak injustice well. There are, it is true, clever persons, who have made a science of this, but their cleverness cannot last for ever; a miserable end awaits them; no one ever yet escaped.

B4465	/	/	it is no joy I feel at this house's misfortunes since I have shared the cup of friendship with it.
B4466	/	/	Zeus will be your advocate in this.
B4469	/	/	There is no justice in mortals' eyes  since before they get sure knowledge of a man's true character they hate him on sight, although he has done them no harm.
B4489	/	/	First, you now live among Greeks and not barbarians, and you understand justice and the rule of law, with no concession to force.
B4494	/	/	If you come to my country, I shall in justice try to act as your protector.
B4499	/	/	Tell him nothing of my intentions, if you are loyal to your mistress and a woman.
B4510	/	/	O detestable creature, utterly hateful to the gods, to me, and to the whole human race,  you brought yourself to take the sword to your own children and destroyed my life with childlessness! And having done this can you look on the sun and the earth, when you are guilty of a most abominable deed? Death and ruin seize you! Now I am in my right mind, though I was insane before  when I brought you from your home among the barbarians to a Greek house. A great curse you were even then, betrayer of father and of the land that nourished you. But the avenging spirit meant for you the gods have visited on me. For you killed your own brother at the hearth  and then stepped aboard the fair-prowed Argo. It was with acts like these that you began. But now when you were married to me and had borne me children, you killed them because of sex and the marriage-bed. No Greek woman  would have dared to do this, yet I married you in preference to them, and a hateful and destructive match it has proved. You are a she-lion, not a woman, with a nature more savage than Scylla the Tuscan monster. But since ten thousand insults of mine would fail  to sting you—such is your native impudence—be gone, doer of disgraceful deeds and murderer of your children! Mine is a fate to bewail: I shall never have the benefit of my new bride, nor will I be able to speak to my children alive,  the children I begot and raised, but have lost them.
B4512	/	/	For a woman of sense, yes. But you find everything a disaster.
B4514	/	/	May the Fury that punishes your children's death, and  Justice the murderous,23 destroy you utterly!
B4520	/	/	This prayer I make, when I behold these aged women, who, leaving their homes in Argos,  now throw themselves with suppliant branches at my knees in their terrible trouble
B4536	/	/	He has my praise, whichever god brought us to live by rule from chaos and from brutishness, first by implanting reason, and next by giving us a tongue to declare our thoughts, so as to know the meaning of what is said,
B4542	/	/	For there are three ranks of citizens; the rich, a useless set, that ever crave for more;  the poor and destitute, fearful folk, that cherish envy more than is right, and shoot out grievous stings against the men who have anything, beguiled as they are by the eloquence of vicious leaders; while the class that is midmost of the three preserves cities,  observing such order as the state ordains.
B4543	/	/	I did not choose you to judge my affliction; no! nor if in anything my fortunes prove me wrong,  did I come to you to punish or correct them, but to seek your help.
B4551	/	/	for this it is that holds men's states together—strict observance of the laws.
B4556	/	/	But I require the whole city's sanction also,  which my wish will ensure; still, by communicating the proposal to them I would find the people better disposed. For I made them supreme, when I set this city free, by giving all an equal vote.
B4558	/	/	for a wretched son is he who does not serve his parents in return—fairest contribution; for, when he made his gift, he in his turn from his own sons receives all such service as he gave to his parents.
B4559	/	/	For pious toil is a fair ornament to cities, and carries with it a grace that never wastes away.
B4560	/	/	O help the mother, city of Pallas, that so they may not pollute the laws of all mankind. You, I know,  reverence right, and to injustice deal out  defeat, a protection at all times to the afflicted.
B4561	/	/	You have made a false beginning to your speech, stranger, in seeking a despot here. For this city is not ruled  by one man, but is free.
B4562	/	/	The people rule in succession year by year, allowing no preference to wealth, but the poor man shares equally with the rich.
B4565	/	/	Nothing is more hostile to a city than a despot;
B4568	/	/	Freedom's mark is also seen in this: “Who has wholesome counsel to declare unto the state?”  And he who chooses to do so gains renown, while he, who has no wish, remains silent. What greater equality can there be in a city?
B4572	/	/	And yet each man among us knows which of the two to prefer, the good or ill, and how much better peace is for mankind than war, peace, the Muses' dearest friend,  the foe of Sorrow, whose joy is in glad throngs of children, and its delight in prosperity. These are the blessings we cast away and wickedly embark on war, man enslaving his weaker brother, and cities following suit.
B4573	/	/	The wise should love their children first, next their parents and country, whose fortunes they ought to increase rather than break down
B4582	/	/	for noble nurture carries reverence with it, and every man, when once he has practised virtue, scorns the name of villain.
B4583	/	/	Courage may be learned, for even a baby learns  to speak and hear things it cannot comprehend; and whatever someone has learned, this it is his wont to treasure up till he is old. So train up your children in a virtuous way.
B4585	/	/	O wretched sons of men!  Why do you get weapons and bring slaughter on one another? Cease from that, give over your toiling, and in mutual peace keep safe your cities.
B4586	/	/	Short is the span of life, so it would be best to run its course as lightly as we may, free from trouble.

Chorus Staggered, he fell to the earth with a crash,torch in hand, a man possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate.  But his threats did not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed each their own dooms with hard blows,Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point.
B4610	/	/	But since Victory whose name is glory has come to us, smiling in joy equal to the joy of chariot-rich Thebes,let us make for ourselves forgetfulness after the recent wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long dance and song.  And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of Thebes, rule our dancing!
B4611	/	/	I knew, first of all, how constant was your reverence for the power of the throne of Laius;  how, again, you were reverent, when Oedipus was guiding our city;  and lastly, how, when he was dead, you still maintained loyal thoughts towards his children.
B4613	/	/	Eteocles, who fell fightingin behalf of our city and who excelled all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that descends to the noblest of the dead below.
B4615	/	/	That is your will, Creon, towards this city's enemy and its friend.  And the power is yours, I believe, to make use of every law whatsoever, both concerning the dead and all us who live.
B4617	/	/	If you do not find the very hand that made this burial, and reveal him before my eyes, mere death shall not suffice for you, not before, hung up alive, you have made this outrage plain,

B4627	/	/	I knew it.  How could I not?
B4634	/	/	Look, here comes Ismene from the palace, shedding the tears of a loving sister.  A cloud over her eyes mars her red-flushed face,and it breaks into rain on her comely cheek.
B4643	/	/	But now, witnessing this, I too am carried beyond the bounds of loyalty.  The power fails me to keep back my streaming tears any longer, when I see Antigone making her way to the chamber where all are laid to rest,now her bridal chamber.
B4647	/	/	Take her away—now!  And when you have enshrouded her, as I proclaimed, in her covered tomb, leave her alone, deserted—let her decide whether she wishes to die or to live entombed in such a home
B4648	/	/	But now, Polyneices, it is for tending your corpse that I win such reward as this. [And yet I honored you rightly, as the wise understand.Never, if I had been a mother of children, or if a husband had been rotting after death, would I have taken that burden upon myself in violation of the citizens' will.  For the sake of what law, you ask, do I say that?  A husband lost, another might have been found,and if bereft of a child, there could be a second from some other man.  But when father and mother are hidden in  Hades, no brother could ever bloom for me again.

I will reward him, and my thanks shall rest with him besides.
B4939	/	/	From which, great prophet, we find you to be our protector and only savior.
B4940	/	/	I order you to abide by you own decree, and from this day forth not to speak to these men or to me: you are the accursed defiler of this land.

B4973	/	/	For my part, I pity him when I think how,with no one to care for him, and seeing no companion's face, but suffering eternally alone, he is plagued by fierce disease and bewildered by each need as it arises.How, how does he endure his bitter fate?

B4981	/	/	I truly marvel how—how in the world—as he listened in solitude to the breakers rushing around him,he kept his hold upon a life so full of grief.
B4982	/	/	Here, he alone was his own neighbor, powerless to walk, with no one in the land to be his companion while he suffered—no one to whom he could cry out a lament that would be answeredfor the plague that gnawed his flesh and drained his blood—no one to lull with healing herbs gathered from the nourishing earth the burning blood which oozed from the ulcers of hisenvenomed foot, whenever the torment attacked him
B4983	/	/	Ah, poor wretch!  Poor man, truly for all your sufferings!
B4984	/	/	Shall I support you, or somehow offer a helping hand?
B4985	/	/	My heart has long been aching for your load of pain.
B4986	/	/	Take heart, we will remain. Philoctetes Will you? Neoptolemus Be sure of it.
B4987	/	/	I could never have expected this, son—that you would have the patience to wait so tenderly upon my sufferings by staying close beside me and helping to relieve me.
B4988	/	/	O Zeus, what shall I do?  Must I be twice found base—by disloyal silence, as well as by shameful speech?
B4990	/	/	A startling pity for him has come upon me—and not now for the first time, but long ago.

B4993	/	/	O, fatherland, and you watchful gods, bring your vengeance, bring your vengeance on them all after so long, if at all you pity me!
B4994	/	/	The boy commands our ship.  Whatever he says to you, that is our answer also.
B4996	/	/	Aim your hate-filled, baneful curse elsewhere, since I prefer that you not reject my friendship.
B4997	/	/	A man must always assert what is right.  But, when he has done so, he must not let loose malignant, stinging taunts.
B5001	/	/	It is true that men are compelled to bear the fortunes given by the gods;
B5002	/	/	For you, certainly, since I am your friend and speak in friendship.
B5003	/	/	Neoptolemus What if they ravage my country? Philoctetes I will be there— Neoptolemus And what aid will you render? Philoctetes —And with the shafts of Heracles— Neoptolemus What? Philoctetes —I will keep them away. Neoptolemus Then say your farewell to this island, and leave with me.
B5005	/	/	But of this be mindful, when you plunder the land—that you show reverence towards the gods.  Do this because Father Zeus regards all else as of less account, and because Piety does not die along with mortals.  Whether they are alive or dead, their piety does not perish.

B5724	/	/	il giovane, conoscendo la tenuità del suo stato e volendosi pur sollevare, si propose di supplire alla povertà della sua sorte con la propria assiduità nelli studii; che perciò datosi alla lettura delli autori latini di prima classe, giunse da per sé stesso a quell'erudizione nelle lettere umane, della quale si mostrò poi in ogni privato congresso, ne' circoli e nell'accademie, riccamente adornato, valendosene mirabilmente con ogni qualità di persona, in qualunque materia, morale o scientifica, seria o faceta, che fosse proposta.
B5730	/	/	In questo mentre con la sagacità del suo ingegno inventò quella semplicissima e regolata misura del tempo per mezzo del pendulo,
B5731	/	/	e facendone esperienze esattissime, si accertò dell'egualità delle sue vibrazioni,
B5733	/	/	della quale invenzione si valse poi in varie esperienze e misure di tempi e moti, e fu il primo che l'applicasse alle osservazioni celesti, con incredibile acquisto nell'astronomia e geografia.
B5734	/	/	Di qui s'accorse che gl'effetti della natura, quantunque apparischin minimi et in niun conto osservabili, non devon mai dal filosofo disprezzarsi, ma tutti egualmente e grandemente stimarsi; essendo perciò solito dire che la natura operava molto col poco, e che le sue operazioni eran tutte in pari grado maravigliose.
B5738	/	/	sovvennegli un nuovo modo esattissimo di poter scoprire il furto di quell'orefice nella corona d'oro di Hierone : et allora scrisse la fabbrica et uso di quella sua bilancetta, per la quale s'ha cognizione delle gravità in specie di diverse materie e della mistione o lega de' metalli,
B5740	/	/	Con questi et altri suoi ingegnosi trovati,
B5742	/	/	inventò quello ch'in tal materia si vede scritto nell'Appendice impressa alla fine de' suoi Dialoghi delle due Nuove Scienze della meccanica e del moto locale, con gran satisfazione e maraviglia del medesimo Sig.r Guidubaldo, il quale per così acute invenzioni l'esaltò a segno appresso il Ser.mo Gran Duca Ferdinando Primo e l'Eccel.mo Principe Don Giovanni de' Medici, ch'in breve divenne a loro gratissimo e familiare:
B5744	/	/	per mezzo d'esperienze
B5746	/	/	dimostrando ciò con replicate esperienze, fatte dall'altezza del Campanile di Pisa con l'intervento delli altri lettori e filosofi e di tutta la scolaresca;
B5748	/	/	giudizio dato da esso sopra una tal macchina, d'invenzione d'un eminente soggetto, proposta per votar la darsina di Livorno, alla quale il Galileo con fondamenti meccanici e con libertà filosofica aveva fatto pronostico di mal evento (come in effetto seguì),
B5751	/	/	nel qual tempo inventò varie macchine in servizio della medesima Republica, con suo grandissimo onore et utile insieme, come dimostrano gl'amplissimi privilegi ottenuti da quella;
B5752	/	/	essendo di esse tanto liberale donatore quanto fecondo compositore.
B5753	/	/	In questi medesimi tempi ritrovò i termometri, cioè quelli strumenti di vetro, con acqua et aria, per distinguer le mutazioni di caldo e freddo e la varietà de' temperamenti de' luoghi;
B5754	/	/	Circa l'anno 1597 inventò il suo mirabile compasso geometrico e militare,
B5758	/	/	In questi medesimi tempi fece studio et osservazione particolare sopra la virtù della calamita
B5759	/	/	trovò modo sicuro di armarne qualunque pezzo, che sostenesse di ferro ottanta e cento volte più che disarmato;
B5762	/	/	il Capra per mezzo di queste sue abominevoli azzioni ne riportò il dovuto premio d'una perpetua ignominia,
B5763	/	/	Non fu già valevole tal Difesa a reprimere l'audacia o la troppa confidenza di alcuni altri d'altre nazioni, i quali, allettati o traportati dalla novità e vaghezza dell'invenzione o dalla mirabil copia e facilità de' suoi usi, non esponessero alle stampe, come interamente lor proprio, questo ingegnoso compasso del Galileo, publicandolo, o con diverse inscrizioni in altra forma ridotto o con nuove linee et ad altri usi ampliato, senza pur far menzione del principale autore di tal strumento;
B5764	/	/	Con questa sola relazione, tornando subito il Sig.r Galileo a Padova, si pose a specularne la fabbrica, quale immediatamente ritrovò la seguente notte: poiché il giorno appresso, componendo lo strumento nel modo che se lo aveva immaginato, non ostante l'imperfezione de' vetri che poté avere, ne vidde l'effetto desiderato,
B5765	/	/	sopra le maggiori altezze della città fece vedere et osservare gl'oggetti in varie lontananze a' primi Senatori di quella Republica, con lor infinita maraviglia; e riducendo lo strumento continuamente a maggior perfezione, si risolse finalmente, con la solita prodigalità nel comunicare le sue invenzioni, di far libero dono di questa ancora al Ser.mo Principe o Doge Leonardo Donati et insieme a tutto 'l Senato Veneto, presentando con lo strumento una scrittura nella quale ei dichiarava la fabbrica, gl'usi e le maravigliose conseguenze che in terra e in mare da quello trar si potevano.
B5766	/	/	sopra le maggiori altezze della città fece vedere et osservare gl'oggetti in varie lontananze a' primi Senatori di quella Republica, con lor infinita maraviglia;
B5767	/	/	si risolse finalmente, con la solita prodigalità nel comunicare le sue invenzioni, di far libero dono di questa ancora al Ser.mo Principe o Doge Leonardo Donati et insieme a tutto 'l Senato Veneto,
B5769	/	/	In gradimento di così nobil regalo fu immediatamente, con generosa dimostrazione della Ser.ma Republica, ne' 25 d'Agosto del 1609 ricondotto il Sig.r Galileo a vita sua alla medesima lettura, con più che triplicato stipendio del maggiore che fusse solito assegnarsi a' lettori di matematica.
B5770	/	/	pensò ancora al modo di perfezionar assai più la nostra vista con fargli perfettamente discernere quelle minuzie le quali, benché situate in qualunque breve distanza dall'occhio, gli si rendono impercettibili; et allora inventò i microscopii d'un convesso e di un concavo, et insieme d'uno e di più convessi, applicandogli a scrupolosa osservazione de' minimi componenti delle materie e della mirabile struttura delle parti e membra delli insetti,
B5771	/	/	conseguitala a gran segno, lasciando di rimirar gl'oggetti terreni, si rivolse a contemplazioni più nobili.
B5772	/	/	E prima, riguardando il corpo lunare, lo scoperse di superficie ineguale, ripieno di cavità e prominenze a guisa della terra. Trovò che la Via Lattea e le nebulose altro non erano ch'una congerie di stelle fisse, che per la loro immensa distanza, o per la lor piccolezza rispetto all'altre, si rendevano impercettibili alla nuda e semplice vista. Vidde sparse per lo cielo altre innumerabili stelle fisse, state incognite all'antichità: e rivolgendosi a Giove con altro migliore strumento, ch'egli s'era nuovamente preparato, l'osservò corteggiato da quattro stelle, che gli s'aggirano intorno per orbi determinati e distinti, con regolati periodi ne' lor moti; e consecrandogli all'immortalità della Ser.ma Casa di V. A., gli diede nome di Stelle o Pianeti Medicei: e tutto questo scoperse in pochi giorni del mese di Gennaio del 1610 secondo lo stile romano, continuando tali osservazioni per tutto 'l Febbraio susseguente; quali tutte manifestò poi al mondo per mezzo del suo Nuncio Sidereo,
B5773	/	/	diedero gran materia di discorsi a' filosofi et astronomi di que' tempi, molti de' quali su 'l principio ebbero gran repugnanza in prestargli fede, e molti temerariamente si sollevarono, altri con scritture private et altri più incauti sin con le stampe , stimando quelle vanità e delirii o finti avvisi del Sig.r Galileo, o pure false apparenze et illusioni de' cristalli; ma in breve gl'uni e gl'altri necessariamente cedettero alle confermazioni de' più savii, all'esperienze et al senso medesimo.
B5775	/	/	all'esperienze et al senso medesimo.
B5779	/	/	per prima assicurarsene con replicate osservazioni, e poter intanto formar concetto della essenza loro e con qualche probabilità almeno pronunciarne la sua oppinione.
B5780	/	/	assicurarsene con replicate osservazioni
B5783	/	/	nel Ser.mo D. Cosimo de' Medici non cedé punto a questa comune curiosità la sua regia munificenza, poi che volle con propria lettera de' 10 Luglio 1610 richiamarlo di Padova al suo servizio con titolo di Primario e Sopraordinario Matematico dello Studio di Pisa, senz'obligo di leggervi o risedervi, e di Primario Filosofo e Matematico della sua Ser.ma Altezza, assegnandogli a vita amplissimo stipendio, proporzionato alla somma generosità di un tanto Principe.
B5785	/	/	Intorno alla fine di Marzo del 1611, desiderato il Sig.r Galileo et aspettato da tutta Roma, quivi si condusse, e nell'Aprile susseguente fece vedere i nuovi spettacoli del cielo a molti SS. Prelati e Cardinali, e particolarmente nel Giardino Quirinale, presente il Sig.r Card.le Bandini et i Mons.ri Dini, Corsini, Cavalcanti, Strozzi, Agucchia, et altri Signori, dimostrò le macchie solari:
B5786	/	/	Avendo dunque egli solo veduto il primo nel cielo tante e così gran maraviglie, state occulte all'antichità, era ben dovere ch'egli in avvenire con nome di Linceo dovesse chiamarsi; onde allora fu quivi ascritto nella famosissima Accademia de' Lincei, poco avanti instituita dal Sig.r Principe Federigo Cesi, Marchese di Monticelli.
B5788	/	/	In occasione delle dispute che nacquero in proposito del galleggiare, soleva dire il Sig.r Galileo, non vi esser più sottile né più industriosa maestra dell'ignoranza, poiché per mezzo di quella gl'era sortito di ritrovare molte ingegnose conclusioni e con nuove et esatte esperienze confermarle per satisfare all'ignoranza delli avversarii, alle quali per appagare il proprio intelletto non si sarebbe applicato.
B5790	/	/	quivi fece scrupolosissime osservazioni intorno alle macchie solari:
B5793	/	/	al conseguimento di ciò si richiedeva un'esatta cognizione de' periodi e moti di quelle stelle,
B5794	/	/	quella non si poteva ottenere se non dal tempo, con moltissime e puntuali osservazioni:
B5795	/	/	quantunque in meno di quindici mesi dal primo discoprimento de' Pianeti Medicei arrivasse ad investigare i lor movimenti con notabile aggiustatezza per le future predizioni, volle però con altre più esquisite osservazioni, e più distanti di tempo, emendargli.
B5797	/	/	per facilitare i mezzi per condurla a buon fine, conferisse a S. Maestà un altro suo nuovo trovato, pur di grandissimo uso et acquisto nella navigazione, da S. A. stimatissimo e custodito con segretezza; et era l'invenzione d'un altro differente occhiale, col quale potevasi dalla cima dell'albero o del calcese d'una galera riconoscer da lontano la qualità, numero e forze de' vasselli nemici, assai prima dell'inimico medesimo, con egual prestezza e facilità che con l'occhio libero, guardandosi in un tempo stesso con amendue gl'occhi, e potendosi di più aver notizia della loro lontananza dalla propria galera, et in modo occultar lo strumento sì che altri non ne apprenda la fabbrica.
B5808	/	/	Fu dalli Stati avidamente abbracciata sì generosa offerta, e nel progresso del trattato fu gradita con lor umanissima lettera, accompagnata con superba collana d'oro,
B5809	/	/	della quale il Sig.r Galileo non volle per allora adornarsi, supplicando gli Stati a compiacersi che il lor regalo si trattenesse in altre mani sin che l'intrapreso negozio fosse ridotto a suo fine, per non dar materia a' maligni suoi emuli di spacciarlo come espilator de' tesori di gran Signori per mezzo di vane oblazioni e presuntuosi concetti.
B5813	/	/	Poco dopo questa inaspettata pubblicazione, concedendomisi l'ingresso nella villa d'Arcetri, dove allor dimorava il sig.r Galileo, acciò quivi io potesse godere de' sapientissimi suoi colloquii e preziosi ammaestramenti, e contentandosi questi che nello studio delle matematiche, alle quali poco avanti mi ero applicato, io ricorresse alla viva sua voce per la soluzione di quei dubbii e difficoltà che per natural fiacchezza del mio ingegno bene spesso incontravo, accadde che nella lettura de' Dialogi sopradetti, arrivando al trattato de' moti locali, dubitai, come pur ad altri era occorso, non già della verità del principio sopra 'l quale è fondata l'intera scienza del moto accelerato, ma della necessità di supporlo come noto; onde io, ricercandolo di più evidenti confermazioni di quel supposto, fui cagione ch'egli nelle vigilie della notte, che allora con gran discapito della vita gli erano familiarissime, ne ritrovò la dimostrazione geometrica, dependente da dottrina da esso pur dimostrata contro ad una conclusione di Pappo (qual si vede nel suo trattato di Meccaniche, stampato dal suddetto P. Mersennio), et a me subito la conferì, sì come ad altri suoi amici ch'eran soliti visitarlo: et alcuni mesi dopo, compiacendosi di tenermi poi di continuo appresso la sua disciplina, per guidarmi, benché cieco come egli era di corpo, d'intelletto però lucidissimo, per il sentiero di quelli studii ch'egli intendeva ch'io proseguisse, imposemi ch'io facesse il disteso di quel teorema, per la difficoltà che gli arrecava la sua cecità nell'esplicarsi dove occorreva usar figure e caratteri; e di questo ne mandò più copie per l'Italia et in Francia alli amici suoi. Per una simil occasione di dubitare mi aveva ancora esplicato una sua considerazione o dimostrazione sopra la 5a e 7a definizione del quinto libro d'Euclide, dettandola a me dopo in dialogo per inserirla in detto suo libro appresso la prima proposizione del moto equabile, quando si fosse ristampato; et è quell'istessa dimostrazione che, a richiesta di V. A. S., fu poi distesa dal Sig.rEvangelista Torricelli, che l'aveva sentita dal medesimo Sig.r Galileo.
B5817	/	/	ben diceva che le principali porte per introdursi nel ricchissimo erario della natural filosofia erano l'osservazioni e l'esperienze,
B5819	/	/	Spese liberalmente in sollevar i depressi, in ricevere et onorare forestieri, in somministrar le comodità necessarie a poveri, eccellenti in qualch'arte o professione, mantenendogli in casa propria finché gli provvedesse di convenevol trattenimento.
B5822	/	/	Fu nelle conversazioni universalmente amabilissimo, poiché discorrendo sul serio era ricchissimo di sentenze e concetti gravi, e ne' discorsi piacevoli l'arguzie et i sali non gli mancavano.
B5823	/	/	Fu dotato dalla natura d'esquisita memoria; e gustando in estremo la poesia, aveva a mente, tra gl'autori latini, gran parte di Vergilio, d'Ovidio, Orazio e di Seneca, e tra i toscani quasi tutto 'l Petrarca, tutte le rime del Berni, e poco meno che tutto il poema di Lodovico Ariosto, che fu sempre il suo autor favorito e celebrato sopra gl'altri poeti, avendogli intorno fatte particolari osservazioni e paralleli col Tasso sopra moltissimi luoghi.
B5824	/	/	Rinovò nella patria, e si può dire nell'Italia, le matematiche e la vera filosofia; e questo non solo con le pubbliche e private lezzioni nelle città di Pisa, Padova, Venezia, Roma e Firenze, ma ancora con le continue dispute che ne' congressi avanti di lui si facevano, instruendo particolarmente moltissimi curiosi ingegni e gran numero di gentiluomini, con lor notabili acquisti. Et in vero il Sig.r Galileo ebbe dalla natura così maravigliosa abilità d'erudire, che gli stessi scolari facevan in breve tempo conoscer la grandezza del loro maestro.

B5876	/	/	et avendo ricevuto lettera dal Sig.r Marco Velsero, Duumviro d'Augusta, accompagnata con tre del suddetto Apelle sopra l'istesso argumento, ne i 4 di Maggio del 1612 rispose a quella con varie considerazioni sopra le lettere del medesimo Apelle, replicando ancora con altra de' 14 d'Agosto susseguente; e ricevendo dal Sig.r Velsero altre speculazioni e discorsi d'Apelle, scrisse la terza lettera del primo di Dicembre prossimo, sempre confermandosi con nuove e più accurate ragioni ne' suoi concetti: e di qui nacque l' Istoria e Demostrazioni delle Macchie Solari e loro accidenti, che nel 1613 fu publicata in Roma dall'Accademia de' Lincei insieme con le suddette lettere e disquisizioni del finto Apelle, dedicandola al medesimo Sig.r Filippo Salviati, nella villa del quale aveva il Sig.r Galileo osservato e scritto sopra queste apparenze; vedendosi in detta istoria ciò che di vero, o di probabile almeno, è stato detto fin ora sopra argumento così difficile e dubbio.
B5877	/	/	Poi che il suddetto Matematico, offendendosi fuor del dovere e contro l'obligo di filosofo che le sue proposizioni non fossero ammesse senz'altro esame per infallibili e vere, o pure anche invidiando alla novità de' concetti così dottamente spiegati nel sopradetto Discorso delle Comete, indi a poco publicò una certa sua Libra astronomica e filosofica, mascherata con finto nome di Lotario Sarsio Sigensano, nella quale trattando con termini poco discreti il Sig.r Mario Guiducci e con molesti punture il Sig.r Galileo, necessitò questo a rispondere col suo Saggiatore, scritto in forma di lettera al Sig.r D. Virginio Cesarini, stampato in Roma nel 1623 dalli Accademici Lincei e dedicato al Sommo Pontefice Urbano Ottavo; per la qual opera chiaramente si scorge, quanto si deva alle persecuzioni delli emuli del Sig.r Galileo, ch'in certo modo sono stati autori di grandissimi acquisti in filosofia, destando in quello concetti altissimi e peregrine speculazioni, delle quali per altro saremmo forse restati privi.
B5879	/	/	fu arrestato nel delizioso palazzo della Trinità de' Monti appresso l'ambasciador di Toscana, et in breve (essendogli dimostrato il suo errore) retrattò, come vero catolico, questa sua opinione

B5899	/	/	indifferently resolved to assent unto that truth which upon deliberation shall seeme most probable unto thy reason,
B5901	/	/	That thou shouldst not here looke to find any exact, accurate Treatise, since this discourse was but the fruit of some lighter studies, and those too hudled up in a short time, being first thought of and finished in the space of some few weekes, and therefore you cannot in reason expect, that it should be so polished, as perhaps, the subject would require, or the leisure of the Author might have done it.
B5903	/	/	Many ancient Philosophers of the better note, have formerly defended this assertion, which I have here laid downe, and it were to be wished, that some of us would more apply our endeavours unto the examination of these old opinions, which though they have for a long time lien neglected by others, yet in them may you finde many truths wellworthy your paines and observation.
B5905	/	/	It is my desire that by the occasion on this discourse, I may raise up some more active spirit to a search after other hidden and unknowne truthes.
B5906	/	/	Since it must needes be a great impediment unto the growth of sciences, for men still so to plod on upon beaten principles, as to be afraid of entertaining any thing that may seeme to contradict them. An unwillingnesse to take such things into examination, is one of those errours of learning in these times observed by the judicious Verulam. Questionlesse there are many secret truths, which the ancients have passed over, that are yet left to make some of our age famous for their discovery.
B5908	/	/	Here is an earnestnesse and hungering after novelty, which doth still adhere unto all our natures, and it is part of that primative image, that wide extent and infinite capacity at first created in the heart of man,
B5914	/	/	It hath alwaies beene the unhappinesse of new truths in Philosophy, to be derided by those that are ignorant of the causes of things,
B5917	/	/	I am resolved that this shall not be any discouragement, since I know that it is not the common opinion of others that can either adde or detract from the truth.
B5920	/	/	hee shall see that the common opposition against this which I affirme cannot any way derogate from its truth.
B5922	/	/	this great ignorance is not so much to be admired in him, as in those learneder men of later times, when all sciences began to flourish in the World.
B5930	/	/	but whether this or what ever else was the meaning of this superstition, yet certainly 'twas a very ridiculous Stome, and bewrayed a great ignorance of those ancient times, especially since it was not onely received by the vulgar, such as were men of Iesse note and Iearning, but believed also, by the more famous and wiser sort
B5932	/	/	plainly declare the insufficiency of common opinion to adde true worth or estimation unto any thing. So that from that which I have said may be gathered thus much.
B5933	/	/	That a new truth may seeme absurd and impossible not onely to the vulgar, but to those also who are otherwise wise men, and excellent schollers; and hence it will follow, that every new thing which seemes to oppose common Principles is not presently to be rejected, but rather to be pry'd into with a diligent enquiry, since there are many things which are yet hid from us, and reserv'd for future discovery.
B5942	/	/	I must needs confesse, though I had often thought with my selfe that it was possible there might be a world in the Moone, yet it seemed such an uncouth opinion that I never durst discover it, for feare of being counted singular and ridiculous, but afterward having read Plutarch, Galilæus, Keplar, with some others, and finding many of mine owne thoughts confirmed by such strong authority, I then concluded that it was not onely possible there might bee, but probable that there was another habitable world in that Planet.
B5945	/	/	That a plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of reason or faith.
B5948	/	/	he confirmes it by the strongest reasons that may be found,
B5952	/	/	Aristotle himselfe was as loth to hold the possibility of a world which he could not discover, as Alexander was to heare of one which he could not conquer. Tis likely that some such by-respect moved him to this opinion, since the arguments he urges for it are confest by his zealous followers and commentators, to be very sleight and frivolous, and they themselves grant, what I am now to prove, that there is not any evidence in the light of naturall reason, which can sufficiently manifest that there is but one world.
B5953	/	/	To it I answer, that this position in Philosophy, doth not bring any inconvenience to the rest, since tis not Aristotle, but truth that should be the rule of our opinions,
B5954	/	/	Plato were his friend, yet hee would rather adhere to truth than him
B5956	/	/	tis not ingratitude to speake against him, when hee opposeth truth;
B5973	/	/	at least not thinke it to be as farre from truth, as it is from common opinion
B5974	/	/	indifferently resolved to assent unto that truth which upon deliberation shall seeme most probable unto thy reason
