Any misunderstanding or miscommunication can lead to a disaster, and with the impulsive leadership we are seeing around the world possibilities are higher than before. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock by 30 seconds in February, which indicates how world leaders are failing in maintaining peace.
D01099	Nuclear disarmament is necessary	in favor of	Several terrorist organizations are also trying very hard to obtain nuclear weapons. Now if by any chance they get nuclear arms there we can’t even imagine the destruction.
D01100	Nuclear disarmament is necessary	in favor of	All the countries do not have very high security for their nuclear arms, apart from going into the wrong hands the system that controls them can also be hacked.
D01101	Nuclear disarmament is necessary	against	Nuclear weapons are extremely lethal and can wipe out life on the Earth, and have actually worked as a deterrence to full-scale wars. We have seen two world wars, and the second one came to an end with a nuclear bomb being dropped by the USA on Japan. Since then, we haven’t seen any open, full-fledged wars, not because there have been no tensions among the countries and we all are living happily, but because of the reason that most of the developed and developing countries have nuclear arms.
D01142	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	against	India has already become a resource-scarce country. We are unable to deliver the basic necessities to genuine Indian citizens, and a large number of additional immigrants will further worsen the conditions. The efficient NRC will help us in identifying illegal immigrants and some steps that can be taken for their deportation.
D01143	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	against	Curbing their voting rights can be beneficial to us. As it will avoid illegal immigrants from swinging elections in favor of those who promise them legitimacy.
D01144	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	against	NRC sends a strong message that illegal immigrants are not welcome here.
D01145	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	The present process lacks impartiality, transparency, and equality. Updating or maintaining an NRC with such a huge population, and that too people with less income and low literacy is a very tedious task. And all efforts should be made to minimize injustice to anyone.
D01146	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	The NRC body and the Foreign Tribunals in Assam are functioning behind the curtains and its functioning is clearly signaling toward the ruling party’s agenda of getting rid of Minorities. Earlier retired judges were carefully selected for Foreign Tribunals but now any lawyer who is above 50 on 25 April 2015 and has 10 years of experience can volunteer for FT and gets a seat. Various online sources have reported that the FT is full of people sharing the ruling party’s ideology and are asked to perform well.
D01147	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	People are tired of showing their documents, and proving their identities but the Foreign Tribunals are never satisfied. Minor clerical mistakes have resulted in the listing of Indian citizens as Foreigners. At times FT has gone beyond scope of its power and ordered arrest, detention, revoked ration cards, etc. thus, troubling a poor Indian.
D01148	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	NRC increases the feeling of alienation among Muslims and animosity among orthodox Hindus, leading to communal unrest which is already on the rise since the BJP came to power.
D01149	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	With this faltering mechanism, already poor and helpless genuine Indians will lose their right to work, healthcare and education, and housing.
D02041	We should develop Web 3.0.	against	There is no guarantee that web 3.0 will not be controlled by big tech companies. Earlier when the first version of the web came, people expected that it will guarantee free speech and no one can control it like they controlled traditional media such as newspapers and television. But, now web content is largely controlled by big corporations. So, web 3.0 may also turn into the same.
D02042	We should develop Web 3.0.	in favor of	Web 3.0 is defined as a decentralized web, where content does not lie in the hands of big corporations. Instead, it uses peer-to-peer infrastructure, so the information cannot be censored by corporations or the government. It is expected to ensure user privacy.
D02054	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	against	This can be a threat to privacy because this linking can lead to the profiling of voters. Several states collected caste, religion, and other sensitive information as part of aadhaar data collection. So, this can be misused by some politicians to selectively eliminate some voters based on their caste or any other identity.
D02055	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	against	If legitimate voters do not have an aadhaar or if they could not link it due to any reason, they will be removed from the list. For example, some homeless people do not have aadhaar cards yet. In the 2018 Telangana Assembly elections, linking aadhaar cards with Voter ID led to the elimination of 20 lakh voters.
D02056	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	against	There are fake and duplicate aadhaar cards too. So, linking aadhaar cards with voter IDs may complicate the issue.
D02057	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	in favor of	This can be used to eliminate fake voter cards. Moreover, some people have voter cards in 2 or more areas. These duplicate voter cards can be eliminated by linking Aadhaar cards with Voter IDs.
D02058	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	in favor of	This linking can clear the path to internet voting or e-voting.
D02063	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	against	The age of 18 years is considered a legal adult in India. They have voting rights too. But not giving them the right to marry the partner of their choice may work against their rights. In 2018, the Law Commission recommended lowering the minimum legal age of men from 21 to 18 years and suggested keeping both genders’ minimum legal age for marriage as 18 years.
D02064	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	in favor of	At present, many girls are forced to drop out of studies for marriage. So, making the minimum legal age for marriage 21 will allow them to continue their studies. Thereby, many more women will go for higher education.
D02065	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	in favor of	Teenage pregnancies increase the risk of high blood pressure, anemia, and several other health problems. It can also lead to the death of the mother due to pregnancy complications. So, raising the age of marriage for girls can reduce the chance of maternal mortality.
D02066	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	in favor of	Early marriages result in several mental health issues in many girls. So, this move can eliminate this problem.
D02067	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	in favor of	As several girls are married at 18 years, they are not having financial independence. This is resulting in dependence on their husbands for survival. The dependence will force them to stay in the relationship even if it is abusive. So, raising the minimum legal age for marriage can empower women and can help them in achieving financial independence before marriage.
D02068	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	against	As per the government data of 2017, the average age of marriage for women is increased to 22.1 years. So, the change is voluntary. The change was mainly due to the improving education among women. So, the solution lies in encouraging education for girls, conducting awareness programs on the importance of education, financial independence and the consequences of teenage pregnancies should be conducted instead of passing a law to bring a real change in society.
D02069	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	against	At present, child marriages are happening throughout India even after ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, of 2006’. As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-2021), 1/4th of the women aged 20-24 years were married before attaining the age of 18 years. After the pandemic, the number of child marriages increased significantly. So, the problem lies in the implementation. Hence the law alone cannot bring a change in society without proper implementation. Root causes should be addressed before bringing a law.
D02070	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	against	Several girls are being forced into marriages due to the patriarchal mindset of their families. Until now, many girls of such families rebelled against such forced marriages and married the person of their choice after attaining 18 years with the help of legal support. But now, they have to wait till attaining 21 years. This will be misused by patriarchal families to threaten and control them.
D03043	Cattle slaughter should be banned	against	Many people are dying of hunger in India. Hunger and malnutrition are the biggest problems India is facing right now. Beef is a cheap protein available to poor people. With the cattle slaughter ban, the malnutrition problem worsens further.
D03044	Cattle slaughter should be banned	against	70% of the cattle in India is owned by marginal farmers. They cannot afford to maintain their cattle after the cattle stop providing benefits to farmers, like providing milk, dung, etc. The only way for farmers is to sell these old animals to slaughterhouses.
D03045	Cattle slaughter should be banned	in favour of	The cow is a sacred animal for Hindus. Killing cows hurts their sentiments.
D03046	Cattle slaughter should be banned	against	It is not ethical to interfere with the food habits of others.
D03047	Cattle slaughter should be banned	in favour of	It is our responsibility to stop cruelty against animals. Article 48 of the Indian constitution mentions that the state should take steps in prohibiting the slaughter of cattle. Many slaughterhouses are still not following the rules to not harass the animals while killing. Animals are subjected to intense suffering at most slaughterhouses.
D03048	Cattle slaughter should be banned	against	Taking action against illegal slaughterhouses is the right step, but banning entire cattle slaughter may not be the right decision by the central government. There are food security and livelihood security issues. It is the responsibility of the government to respect everyone’s choices equally.
D03049	Hindi should be the national language of India	against	English is an international language and is spoken by most of Indians. So, if Hindi is made the national language, people who cannot speak Hindi will be at disadvantage in many things such as getting government jobs, understanding circulars, etc.
D03050	Hindi should be the national language of India	against	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.
D03051	Hindi should be the national language of India	in favour of	English is not native to India, but Hindi is.
D03052	Hindi should be the national language of India	in favour of	Hindi is spoken by more than half of India. As no single language is spoken by the entire of India, it is much better to make the majoritarian language the national language. 
D03053	Hindi should be the national language of India	against	Almost half of India’s mother tongue is not Hindi. There are 22 officially recognized regional languages in India. Making a majoritarian language the national language is unconstitutional.
D27001	Human Gene editing is a good thing	in favor of	DNA has got nothing to do with spirituality. It is made up of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen - the very same elements that make up the majority atmosphere. It is just as godlike as is the air around us.
D27002	Human Gene editing is a good thing	in favor of	Some people who believe in modifying the genes believe that it not only increases the span of life but also increases the quality of life.
D27003	Human Gene editing is a good thing	in favor of	Genetic Diseases affect only a minority. The majority doesn't understand the pain and politicizes the situation.
D27006	It is right to ban Cattle Slaughter 	in favor of	Cow is a sacred animal for Hindus. Killing cows hurts their sentiments.
D27007	It is right to ban Cattle Slaughter 	against	Many people are dying of hunger in India. Hunger and malnutrition are biggest problems India is facing right now. Beef is a cheap protein available to poor people. With the cattle slaughter ban, malnutrition problem worsens further.
D27008	Hindi should be the National language of India	in favor of	Hindi is spoken by more than half of India. As no single language is spoken by entire India, it is much better to make the majoritarian language as the national language.
D27009	Hindi should be the National language of India	against	There are widespread protests against the imposition of Hindi because non-Hindi speaking states are much more comfortable with English than Hindi.
D27010	Hindi should be the National language of India	against	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.
D27018	MBAs do not make good business leaders	against	The curriculum and the educational procedure in any MBA institutes lack hands-on practice over live projects in order to train them and give them a chance to work on their leadership skills. Instead of focussing on the technical aspects of business marketing, development of leadership along with interpersonal skills is extremely important.
D27019	MBAs do not make good business leaders	in favor of	MBA programs are the best in shaping personality and behavioural skills, which are the most essential qualities of leaders.
D27020	MBAs do not make good business leaders	in favor of	Learning everything by practice consumes time. Through MBA, we can learn management skills and skills to tackle real-life problems in businesses.
D27042	"Bullet for Bullet" is a right policy	against	As per Gandhiji's words "An Eye for an Eye leaves the whole world Blind", bullet for bullet is not a right policy.
D27043	"Bullet for Bullet" is a right policy	in favor of	If we keep on forgiving the terrorists, terrorism will not be eliminated.
D27061	Temples in India can have Gender-Specific rules	against	Though religions can have personal laws. Religious institutions do not have right to ban women from entering into worship places.
D27062	Temples in India can have Gender-Specific rules	in favor of	Some temples have their own reasons. For example, if we take Sabarimala, Lord Ayyappan is a celibate. So, the temple management opines that allowing women to this temple is against God's will.
D27063	Temples in India can have Gender-Specific rules	against	In the past, there were restrictions to lower castes in temples. But as we progress these restrictions were eliminated. We should value ethics more than customs.
D27069	The Internet should be censored	in favor of	Internet censorship helps in maintaining Cybersecurity.
D27070	The Internet should be censored	in favor of	Rapidly increasing piracy need to be curtailed through censorship.
D27077	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India	in favor of	Compulsory military training can also make people stronger physically &amp; emotionally.
D27078	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India	against	Most of the reserve force will not be utilized, which means huge amounts of expenditure on trainings will go in vain.
D27079	Military training should be made compulsory for all in India	against	Some people do not have enough strength to participate in such intense trainings. They may seem normal from outside but may have mental illnesses. Military trainings can be emotionally and physically daunting for them. In such cases compulsory trainings will be a threat to their life.
D27082	Adultery should be criminalized	in favor of	Fear of law can deter people from committing adultery.
D27083	Adultery should be criminalized	against	Law should not interfere in the personal lives.
D27084	Adultery should be criminalized	against	Families will be broke if one of the parent sends the other one to jail. It creates a lot of mental trauma to the children involved.
D27085	Women can be in combat roles	against	Biologically, men are stronger than women. Hence, it may not be wise to deploy people in the field that have less physical strength than the enemy.
D27086	Women can be in combat roles	against	There are no much facilities and infrastructure in Indian Army to allow women in combat roles.
D27090	Reservations in India should be based on economic status	in favor of	Caste divisions are hatred among communities is increasing due to reservations. Many communities in several states of India are fighting to give them reservations. And the consequence is people are increasingly associating with their caste. The interesting fact is that before the first caste census by British government (1881) in India, many people do not even know what their caste is. From then, the idea of caste is deeply ingrained in the Indian society. Now the reservations are making the situation even worse.
D27091	Reservations in India should be based on economic status	against	In India, it's easy to hide some income resources and to get a false income certificate. Though the situations are changing for the better, it is not that difficult.
D27098	India is safe for women	in favor of	Evil historic practices on women in the pre and post medieval period have been into oblivion. Practices like child marriages, polygamy, ban on remarriages, honor killings, Sati, Jauhar and Purdah are obsolete in today's world. With time, more such practices are being redundant and thus, increasing safety measures.
D27099	India is safe for women	in favor of	Women of our country have been and are achieving the epitomes of success and glory every other day. Prominent personalities like Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Sarla Thakral, Kalpana Chawla, Sister Nivedita, Sarojini Naidu, and many more have been conquering their respective fields for centuries. In recent times, Prativa Patil, Meira Kumar, Priyanka N., Mitali Madhumita, Tanushree Pareek are some of the women achievers to be the queens. With such accomplishments happening around, safety can be guaranteed to a big extent.
D27100	India is safe for women	against	The National Crime Records Bureau states that happenings of crimes against women have risen from 273 per day in 2001 to 313 per day in 2015. This is not a good sign in terms of safety in India.
E01001	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	against	We should never ever allow any nuclear power after Fukushima!
E01004	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources	in favor of	'People highlight various risks, but any generation technology comes with risks: the largest electricity-related disaster (Banquiao dam in 1976) took the lives of 200000 people (!) or just recently 70 people in Russia, but nobody talks about hydropower being 'deadly' or complaining about states providing insurance for such massive projects, because it happens for all projects of such scale. 
E01005	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources	in favor of	There is no generation technology that comes with zero risks, and this is why we need to look at objective scientific indicators.
E01006	We should promote the use of nuclear energy instead of renewable energy sources	in favor of	In the UK since 2015, there were over 80 PV-related fires, at least 1/4 of which were actually solar panels catching fire, releasing toxic smoke, and contaminating the ground with cadmium. 
E01007	We should include young people in decision-making processes considering climate change	in favor of	Youth is a minority that will face the negative effects of climate change without being able to sufficiently participate in climate governance. 
E01008	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy	against	Fossil-sourced natural gas is as harmful as coal or oil. If it is sourced from fossil fuels, natural gas produces a net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere when burned.
E01009	We should stop subsidies and other incentives for bioenergy	against	Some biofuels, such as soy, corn, sugar cane, rapeseed, and palm oil encourage deforestation
E01014	We should invest in sustainable alternative fuels for aviation	in favor of	These fuels currently cost 2 to 5 times more than kerosene. Facilitating and multiplying its production will automatically reduce its cost. 
E01015	We should invest in sustainable alternative fuels for aviation	in favor of	Sustainable alternative fuels allow emission reductions of up to 80%.
E01019	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects	against	if you want to save birds, you perhaps should think about domesticated cats and making modern buildings more bird-friendly. If you want to save insects, look at the way of land use and agriculture, and create insect-friendly gardens.
E01024	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)	in favor of	Currently the ETS only applies to certain carbon-emitting industries covering 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. To effectively combat climate change 40% is not enough. That is why the ETS has to be expanded to at least cover agriculture and transport as well.  In Addition to the extension of the ETS the subsidies in fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) must be cut in the near future.
E01025	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	nuclear power plants which, compared to fossil fuel-fired power plants, have decreased carbon dioxide emissions and produce incomparably less toxic substances, which, moreover, are not emitted into the air we breathe, but can be buried deep underground where they will not harm anyone. 
E01026	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities 	in favor of	This will reduce pollution and make people have better health, while at the same time reducing the impact on their budget and on the environment.  What are we waiting for?
E01027	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	against	At this stage it is not worth investing money in current nuclear technology, what we should be doing is investing more in research into nuclear fusion energy, which is really the clean and safe energy we need and which we are getting closer and closer to achieving, in order to have those artificial suns working as soon as possible.  
E01028	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	against	Renewable energies should be our focus of action, especially how to improve the storage and transport of this energy precisely in order to be able to supply the countries that have the worst conditions to implement them. 
E01031	We should reintroduce nuclear power in Germany	against	A technology that takes 20 - 40 years to build up on any meaningful scale, and takes many decades to pay its costs, if ever? 
E01032	We should reintroduce nuclear power in Germany	against	With tens of thousands of years where you have to guard and manage the nuclear waste? Not really, sorry. 
E01033	We should support short-distance economies	in favor of	Economies within a short distance, decentralization, and localization can be efficient tools for protecting the climate and the environment. Less transportation, consumption of local resources, and a high level of self-reliance in the energy and food sector lead to lower carbon footprints.
E01034	We should support short-distance economies	in favor of	supporting short-distance economies can help kick off the development of localized small-scale economies.
E01035	We should invest in R&D   	in favor of	Investing in R&D will create an incentive system for businesses to start with green solutions.
E01036	We should protect very large natural areas	in favor of	To help achieve this, the EU should reduce its excessive livestock subsidies. An agricultural transition away from cattle towards plants would free up a lot of space
E01037	We should protect very large natural areas	in favor of	Very large natural areas need to be protected to promote wildlife and the return of self-sustaining and fertile biodiversity!
E01044	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	Europe must be a place that follows science, and following science nuclear power is an important tool in our fight against climate change.
E01050	We should prohibit the sale of washing machines without suitable filters	in favor of	washing machines without proper filters are a major source of microplastic.
E01051	We should prohibit the sale of washing machines without suitable filters	in favor of	Prohibiting washing machines without suitable filters will prevent groundwater pollution.
E01056	We should increase the legal warranty from 2 years to 5 years on all products in Europe	in favor of	It would force manufacturers to build longer-lasting products, and therefore reduce the impact on the environment and resources
E01065	We should use available solutions to make flying more sustainable right now	in favor of	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now.  SAFs are not made from fossil fuels, but from CO2 that has been taken out of the air recently, either by biological processes or through technology. 
E01069	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups	against	Subsidizing big agricultural companies is not the problem here, it's the criteria by which the subsidies are distributed.
E01070	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy	against	In the case of nuclear power, cooling is needed to prevent a meltdown. And if water is not available because of drought or freezing, earthquake or tsunami, etc, these gigantic steam engines have to be shut down, otherwise, they will produce highly hazardous outcomes.
E01071	We should tax heavily or refuse to import products not manufactured in the European Union that do not comply with our climate standards	in favor of	Heavy taxation of imported goods will encourage the relaunch of European production, which is more environmentally friendly.
E01072	We should tax heavily or refuse to import products not manufactured in the European Union that do not comply with our climate standards	in favor of	Heavy taxation of imported goods will encourage the relaunch of European production, which has better social values
E01073	We should put in place policies for the protection of insects	in favor of	A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations, and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. 
E01076	We should invest in sustainable alternative fuels for aviation	against	biofuel is much nonsense as would require huge areas and resources to be produced.
E01077	We should invest in sustainable alternative fuels for aviation	against	climate models (e.g. CO2 affecting anthropogenic climate warming) have not been validated.
E01078	We should invest in sustainable alternative fuels for aviation	against	sustainable fuel is a fraud that allows industrial sectors (in this case airlines) to be compensated for change management they should themselves pay via R&D
E01080	Wind and solar energy resources are a commodity, provided by big companies.	against	Energy is a human right and free energy production is a human right as well.
E01081	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	Worldwide, nuclear power has prevented emissions of 240 billion tonnes of CO2 and prevented 1.8 million lives due to prevented air pollution (Kharecha, Hansen 2013). 
E01082	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	Nuclear power is safe - there are over 400 nuclear power plants globally, most of which have operated with no issues for the last 40 years, providing 24/7 electricity and preventing pollution and CO2 emissions. In terms of safety, including all accidents and pollution, nuclear power has caused 0.07 deaths/TWh, which is 40x less than natural gas and comparable with wind power (OurWorldInData 2021). 
E01083	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	Nuclear power takes little space, and unlike wind and solar works 24/7 and 7 years to build on average.
E01092	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good	against	There are whole regions that are completely energy-autonomous with wind energy, solar power & biogas - not only in developing countries but in industrialized countries as well. It's not a question of technology, but just of mindset & innovative arrangement.
E01093	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good	against	Where energy costs for consumers are high in combination with renewables, it's mostly due to political decisions and market set-up, not due to technical issues. Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.
E01094	We should protect 20% of land in each European country to restore biodiversity	in favor of	This is really crucial in order to stop warming, locally, eventually regionally or nationally, and globally. The more intact ecosystems we have, the more likely we can stop global warming.
E01099	We should invest in nuclear energy	in favor of	wind and solar power sources are inherently non-controllable and destroy our landscapes and natural environment, with their multiple harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects.
E01100	We should invest in nuclear energy	in favor of	Nuclear energy is undoubtedly the best form of electricity production, massive and controllable, with no CO²/GHG emissions. 
E01101	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain	in favor of	What is edible, should be given to humans. What humans cannot eat, should be available for animals. What both cannot use, should go to biogas plants. The solid waste from biogas plants can be transformed into excellent compost. Runoff from biogas plants can be treated & provide H2. And the heat from biogas plants can provide heating or other forms of energy.
E01102	We should protect bird habitats in built environments	in favor of	Glass is one of the biggest causes of human death for birds.
E01103	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	against	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable.
E01104	We should include young people in decision-making processes considering climate change	in favor of	Including young people in decision-making processes considering climate change could potentially help to address the gap between the widespread official rhetoric claiming a great interest in involving young people in discussion and policymaking when it comes to climate protection and politics in general and the reality that falls too often too short of these declarations.
E01105	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	against	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military. 
E01106	We should limit the number of plastic types used for packaging	in favor of	limiting the number of plastic types used for packaging will decrease the emissions caused by burning the used plastic packaging, as well as decrease the amount of plastic in the ocean
E01107	We should limit the number of plastic types used for packaging	in favor of	limiting the number of plastic types used for packaging will ease the process of its recycling
E01108	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	against	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. We have some conditions for sustainable green energy (at least solar, wind, biomethane etc.). 
E01109	We should stop subsidizing mass livestock farms	in favor of	The EU has “beautiful” ideas and is working on legislation for animal welfare and the environment. But as long as EU subsidies still support mass animal farms, all of this is not credible!
E01112	We should make healthy food cheaper than unhealthy food	in favor of	creating a European sustainability tax for all products and services from inside and outside the EU based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations will make all unsustainable products more expensive and sustainable products more competitive
E01113	We should preserve bees and polling insects	in favor of	Bees and pollination are essential for the sexual reproduction of plants and are an important factor in biodiversity.
E01114	We should preserve bees and polling insects	in favor of	The economic value of polling insects, often bees, is estimated by researchers to be EUR 153 trillion. 9.5% of the total value of world food production. 
E01117	We should promote a culture of exchange and sharing of goods and services	in favor of	In this case, the service generates profit, not the product.
E01118	We should promote a culture of exchange and sharing of goods and services	in favor of	All this lengthens the life cycle of a product and reduces waste.
E01119	We should take polyester and other toxic substances out of clothing and place them with natural materials	against	Natural materials have a large carbon footprint. They require fresh water and land, contributing to the pressure on nature and resources around the world. 
E01120	We should use the waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain	in favor of	allow it to be handed out to charities for consumption by those in need. 
E01121	We should use the waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain	in favor of	The fruit and vegetable sector is able to produce a large quantity of waste products which, if well reused, could be used for animal feed.
E01126	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition	in favor of	A great idea because it definitely lowers the threshold. 
E01127	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition	in favor of	It's high time that all broadcasting stations in the EU stimulate their journalists to cover European news as well.
E01128	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition	in favor of	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to discover the possibility to work for the EU
E01129	We should open free training centers for the EPSO competition	in favor of	This would be an opportunity for more Europeans to integrate people with different backgrounds within the institutions. 
E01130	We should limit the use of fireworks	in favor of	I have also seen ex-soldiers shaking after someone sets off loud fireworks. Yes they should be banned.  Abhorrent things.
E01132	We should limit the use of fireworks	in favor of	All animals from dogs, cats, birds, cows, pigs, and horses (the list is long) suffer from human use of fireworks! The high bursts and flashes cause anxiety in the body. 
E01142	We should introduce a European citizenship	in favor of	The only ones who benefit from people having several citizenships in different EU countries are the governments because they collect money for issuing passports.
E01143	We should introduce a European citizenship	in favor of	Why have several EU passports when they actually represent one and the same thing?
E01146	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools	in favor of	Makes sense to me, its easy to learn and doesn't come with any nationalist baggage.
E01147	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools	in favor of	EU lacks a common language for its citizens, which would be easy to manage for all citizens and strengthen a sense of belonging, a common European identity while preserving their national identities.
E01152	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools	against	I can't endorse this. Esperanto isn't neutral. It favors Spanish speakers. Meanwhile, Slavic speakers are at a disadvantage. So why not one of the Slavic artificial languages?
E01159	We should limit the use of fireworks	in favor of	Fireworks are an especially selfish source of entertainment.
E01163	We should teach Esperanto, a common and neutral language, at all European schools	in favor of	Esperanto can be a new tool for a more united European Union.
E02095	We should implement minimum EU social standards	in favor of	To reduce poverty and inequalities, the EU should develop a legal framework guaranteeing minimum social standards, including decent living and working conditions as well as adequate social protection.
E02096	We should improve migration policies	against	No more immigration! It has already come at too large of a cost. The EU must provide channels for the European people to democratically vote for the mass deportation of migrants.
E02097	We should improve migration policies 	in favor of	The EU could play an important role in combatting misconceptions about immigration.  Immigration needs to be controlled sensibly and immigrants should be taught European values and principles as well as the language of the host country. 
E02098	We should improve migration policies 	in favor of	Avoiding non-EU countries to stop migrants’ journey to the EU payments to systemic violation of human rights and dignity.
E02099	We should improve migration policies 	in favor of	The only meaningful immigration is when there is a member country with a specific vacancy. That member will also be responsible for the integration (at a cost of Euro 167,000). The EU has only to administer the paperwork and supervise if matters spin out of control. 
E02100	We should improve migration policies 	against	It may be great to admit a few talented immigrants, but the EU is now following its steep nose dive leading to the rapid disappearance of Europe.
E02101	We should include limited profitability enterprises in the EU treaties	in favor of	I'd like to see inclusive legislation which considers all sorts of social businesses, gives them good protection and possibilities to develop. We need a EU social business lab to help develop, foster and research social businesses. 
E02102	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions	against	So to support European citizens you want to take more money from them? 
E02103	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions	in favor of	Having many individuals in the EU paying a voluntary tax can contribute big time to the perceived democratic legitimacy of the EU. 
E02104	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions	in favor of	Tax should be compulsory, not voluntary!  Yes, the EU needs to collect direct taxes! For example, taxes on companies, and green taxes (tax on non-recycled items, tax on carbon, etc), as all should be harmonized across the EU.
E02105	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions	in favor of	The money from this could be allocated to pan-European projects, new citizen services, etc, tangible and prestigious results that may prompt others to join in.
E02106	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU	against	Europeans must embrace true values that enhance life and standards of living.  Anything related to drugs, in whatever form, degenerates humanity.  Soon enough we will be legalizing 'theft' in an effort to improve GDP and growth, as European colonialists have done in Africa and Asia where oppression and exploitation ruled. 
E02107	We should make living wages a human right	in favor of	Many people, even in the richest European countries, work hard, work overtime or have several jobs & cannot sustain themselves. That's humiliating, time-consuming alien to physical & mental health, and poisoning society.  
E02108	We should make living wages a human right	in favor of	Nations that have adopted living wages for full-time jobs have highly profited from that step. It's been an economic booster because if people who earn & possess little can afford what they need, they will buy. So they increase demand. Demand increases supply. More supply means more jobs, more suppliers, lower costs, etc. 
E02109	We should make pushbacks legal 	in favor of	Pushbacks may not be a nice way of operating. However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU.  It would be much better by refusing admission to anyone appearing at the border without papers.  The experience is that over 80% of the immigrants are not refugees in danger.
E02110	We should make pushbacks legal 	in favor of	We need to legalize pushbacks as a tool to limit illegal migration.
E02111	We should preserve European culture	in favor of	We should embrace and protect our culture which stands at the basis of our successful society.  We also should watch out for some Europhiles in Brussels who think our culture should be replaced by multi-culturalism because it fits the EU plans better.
E02112	We should preserve European culture	in favor of	Europe’s rapid Islamisation must be stopped. It is, therefore, necessary to stop the illegal migration of African and Asian people who do not fit with European culture.
E02113	We should preserve European culture	against	Multiculturalism will enhance our society.
E02114	We should put a cap on personal wealth and annual income	against	Yes, Communism worked great, everywhere they tried. Oh wait...
E02115	We should put a cap on personal wealth and annual income 	in favor of	Having an upper limit for annual income would make our society fairer, more inclusive, and overall a better society for everybody
E02116	We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology	against	Capitalism and the free market indeed created western wealth. However, the interesting question then is: who benefited from this wealth? Without some sort of regulation and control from the State, companies will continue what they do best, increase profit without any concern for environmental and social matters. 
E02117	We should stop hosting migrants from Muslim countries	in favor of	Islam represents the biggest threat to democracy in the EU since it’s not compatible with European values. Islam, it’s not only a religion but almost a constitution which trying to impose on European society. 
E02118	We should stop hosting migrants from Muslim countries	in favor of	EU leaders continue their naive policy of hosting millions of migrants from Muslim countries without taking into consideration the inability to integrate into society even after many generations,  and the fact that the Muslim diaspora is controlled by their countries of origin, the most flagrant example is the interference of Turkey and its dictator Erdogan in the German elections calling the Turkish diaspora to boycott this election since none of the candidates please him. 
E03004	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	It makes no difference where we place the population of the world. Either in or out of EU, the western way of living is unsustainable.
E03005	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	The nations of Europe are the most responsible for the state of the global climate and we need to take the responsibility.
E03006	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	People are migrating from poorer countries with difficult local climates because the nations of Europe made those countries poor and destroyed the climate.
E03007	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	We are all one and the same on this tiny wet space rock. We need to come together if we want to survive.
E03008	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	We just need to define the values and laws of our utopia and give people the resources to join together in building it.
E03013	We should promote a plant-based diet	in favor of	While it is only promoted/suggested and not a mandatory, its ok.
E03014	We should promote a plant-based diet	in favor of	Obviously, this is the future: less suffering animals, more plants, less CO2, more healthier people.... and don't forget the artificial meat as an alternative or first step.
E03015	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans	against	Sounds a little xenophobic. There is no concept of indigenous or aborigenous population in Europe, the only criteria is citizenship.
E03016	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	Are IQ test really worth anything? Stick to teaching the language and basic values, the rest will follow.
E03017	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging	in favor of	Wood should be used as building material & other meaningful products only. Anything else is a waste of resources. No fresh wood for paper, fast furniture 
E03018	We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports	against	Please consider this: right now in Africa several million people are half starved, and eat a meal a day at best. They live thanks to cheap agricultural products coming from Europe, because local stuff is too expensive for them.
E03019	We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports	against	It will take years before the local farmers will be able to give well paid jobs to the local workers. In the meantime you'll have a famine and a genocide. And I didn't even mention the effects of a sudden huge inflation wave.
E03020	We should prohibit certain energy-intensive cryptocurrencies	in favor of	According to BBC: 'Bitcoin uses more electricity annually than the whole of Argentina'
E03025	We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure	in favor of	A green initiative that I can endorse whole-heartedly. Rational environmentalism can save both our planet and our democracy (from the menace of the radical Greens).
E03026	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	IQ tests do not prevent ill-intentioned people from entering our borders. Canada aims to receive 400,000 people each year, and how intelligent or skilled they are does not matter. People working in the agricultural fields are being naturalized, relatives are being naturalized.
E03027	We should prohibit internal combustion engines	against	Not all combustion engines use petrol as a fuel - natural gas engines are way more environment-friendly
E03028	We should sponsor the general population for taking in migrants	against	Integrating one non-western immigrant cost ca. Euro 167,000,-. Who will be paying that ?
E03031	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	in favor of	The real problem, even with the war refugees is that once they enter the EU they do not want to return to their countries, even if the danger has passed. They even bring their family and other relatives!
E03033	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	This is a huge discrimination.  Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm. 
E03037	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste	in favor of	To create value directly in the rural areas, is very important.
E03038	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste	in favor of	Making compost out of organic waste and distribute it to gardeners and farmers will help to create value and a better environment.
E03041	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable	in favor of	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise. As far as I know, all or most countries have agreed on these goals. The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.
E03042	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable	in favor of	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.
E03045	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	Some of the 9/11 Terrorists were well educated. IQ proves nothing, I'd better welcome good people than smart people.
E03047	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	I don't see how stopping putting a stop to migration will suddenly impact our eco footprint in that extend. Firstly, migration is in our nature. Without migration you wouldn't be here.  second, the cost of migration is self-sustained.
E03048	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	A migrant, with the proper education and support, will in his turn contribute for society, which allows more people to have a fulfilling life.
E03049	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	Instead we should look into investing in foreign countries and help building a stable environment.
E03050	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.	in favor of	I absolutely agree that solar power plants should not be deployed on fertile, arable land & wood should not be cut down to make place for this endeavor. This needs to be regulated swiftly!
E03057	We should not produce unnecessary garbage	in favor of	Things that are supposed to serve us for a long time, like a vehicle or telecommunication device or household implements should be designed to last half a lifetime under normal use. The quality of the building material should matter more in that instance, so less focus on recycling.
E03058	We should not produce unnecessary garbage	in favor of	Things that are one-time use only, like most packaging and the like, should be radically focused on recycling potential.
E03059	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	People from several countries are asking for asylum in Europe in hope of better life conditions. Those people aren’t guilty for being born in those countries and EU should support everyone.
E03060	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal	against	If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth.
E03061	We should label products with environmental impact and climate impacts in clear language	in favor of	Extremely important thing for an informed decision of the citizens e.g. in the supermarket.
E03065	We should support agroforestry	in favor of	Changes in management practices, and above all the integration of trees in arable and pastoral lands, are key, and could turn agriculture from a net emitter to a net absorber of greenhouse gases.
E03068	We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)	in favor of	Agrivoltaic could be a perfect model for an energy cooperation of citizens to own some greenhouses with photovoltaic & rent them for a small fee to a urban gardening cooperation of citizens, for example. 
E03069	We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.	in favor of	I agree! So perhaps we will have less meat but also less pollution, and much more quality of meat, of air and of environment
E03070	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	If we tried to fix the issue by controlling the population, countries like Denmark would need to reduce their population to 1/5 of the current number, to reach sustainable resource use.
E03071	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	Instead we need to change our behavior, reduce our consumerism and decrease our overall resource use per person.
E03072	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	Instead we need to reduce inequality in between countries and distribute wealth more evenly around the world.
E03073	We should promote a plant-based diet	in favor of	The environmental impact of a given product should also be stated on its package and/or in menus in order to raise awareness on the subject.
E03074	We should promote a plant-based diet	in favor of	In addition to this, schools and companies canteens should be required to serve mainly plant-based meals in order to reduce their impact and to educate their users.
E03076	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans	in favor of	European Union has already forgotten for example about the Ingrian Finnish indigenous nation. We have our own unique flag, our own unique language (that only about 1300 people speak in the entire world), our own land that the Ingrian Finnish lived on before Russia took over Karelia and sent them all to labor work in Siberia, Karelian forests and Estonia.
E03079	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	Stopping immigration as an excuse to not adopt proper anticonsumerist and industry-regulating policies will not solve anything for the environment and will only increase interethnic and interracial tensions.
E03080	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist  authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.   
E03081	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	IQ is not an effective measure of whether they'll be economically beneficial, suited to European jobs  in high demand, likely to integrate/assimilate, their potential to cause crime etc.
E03082	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	This just seems like an overtly emotional suggestion that isn't too well thought out. It would cause far more problems that it solves.
E03088	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare	in favor of	Fish are sentient and failure to afford them the same legal protections that we provide other animals is a gross moral and legal oversight.
E03089	We should reduce animal farming.	in favor of	We should encourage people to consider the question: 'Do you think it is morally right to torture, mutilate, and kill animals needlessly?'
E03090	We should reduce animal farming.	in favor of	We can work together to encourage plant based diets and make the world a better place.
E04012	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed.
E04015	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	Unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants have no right to be in the country where they are unauthorized.
E04016	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing. 	against	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.
E04026	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	in favor of	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop the conflict.
E04027	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	in favor of	 Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop immigration.
E04030	We should not have illegal immigrants!	in favor of	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields.
E04031	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	in favor of	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.
E04032	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	in favor of	 Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!
E04036	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	Illegal loopholes in the legislation are enabling illegal migration. Family Reunification has been and remains the biggest channel of migration into the EU.
E04037	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	The procedure of Family Reunification is already causing major problems in the USA. 
E04038	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	Family Reunification creates unbearable levels of migration and acute problems of integration for several EU Member States.
E04041	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	in favor of	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging.
E04042	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	in favor of	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.
E04047	We should stop mass migration.	in favor of	Organizing, promoting, directing and financing mass migration is a crime against humanity.
E04050	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	No more immigration from non-European or non-first world countries.
E04051	We should restrict immigration.	in favor of	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.
E04052	We should restrict immigration.	in favor of	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us.
E04075	We should protect the European border	in favor of	Only together and with  Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.
E04084	We should remove illegal immigrants.	in favor of	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe. 
E04086	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.  
E04087	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly. 
E04088	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings?
E04098	We should protect the European border	in favor of	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years. 
E04104	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work!  What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights
E04118	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.
E04129	We should punish illegal immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.
E04133	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex). 
E04134	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.
E04137	We should stop integration.	in favor of	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.
E04152	We should support Frontex.	in favor of	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission. 
E04153	We should support Frontex.	in favor of	 The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.
E04156	We should stop immigration.	in favor of	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa.  Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.
E04158	We should stop immigration.	in favor of	The organization of mass migration is a heinous crime. No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
E04160	We should protect the European border.	in favor of	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.
E05011	We should increase the salaries of artisans	against	I think that people should grow, learn and move into better-paid jobs. Today there are fantastic opportunities, e.g. Artificial General Intelligence is being built, and human anti-aging and even rejuvenation therapies are being developed: these are only a few areas where the most pressing need of humanity is being met. People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development.
E05014	We should stop making one-cent coins	in favor of	The convenience of carrying fewer coins is obvious.
E05015	We should stop making one-cent coins	in favor of	A one-cent coin costs about 60% more to produce than it is actually worth. 
E05021	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	in favor of	The use and promotion of civic technology contribute to a more inclusive, resident-focused urban co-governance model and build ecosystems rich in creativity and innovation, thanks to the diversity of users and perspectives that are at stake.
E05022	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	in favor of	These platforms are an opportunity to encourage the creation of public value and new forms of citizen participation, especially in urban areas. 
E05023	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	in favor of	In an era of weakening of political parties and distrust of the electorate for them, the future of democracy depends on the re-evaluation of the role of institutions and the direct involvement of citizens to investigate and understand the problems. 
E05024	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	in favor of	Civic technologies can support the co-creation, co-production, and co-management of public services with citizens and the development of the urban commoning approach.
E05032	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making	in favor of	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments.
E05033	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making	in favor of	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament. 
E05096	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities	in favor of	The bicycle should be the main mode of transport for a majority of citizens because it is faster, it is easier, it is healthier, it is cheaper, it is more convenient, and it is eco-friendly.
E05097	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities	in favor of	Having cycling and micromobility as primary modes also makes cities quieter, less congested, less polluted, safer, and simply more pleasant and liveable, particularly for children.
E05104	We should promote mental health	in favor of	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them.
E05105	We should promote mental health	in favor of	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health. 
E05106	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries	in favor of	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle!
E05111	We should stop daylight saving time change	against	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.
E05112	We should stop daylight saving time change	against	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.
E05136	We should stop daylight saving time change	in favor of	 All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.
E05141	We should stop daylight saving time change	in favor of	If the European Council listened to the results of the inquiry made by the European Commission. 'The EU was set to stop changing its clocks in 2021, but then came Brexit, the pandemic, and some messy international bureaucracy'.
E05142	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection	in favor of	A reflection on the future of Europe needs to identify and involve other actors alongside local and international institutions to fully deploy the founding values of our continent in addressing major global challenges. 
E05143	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection	in favor of	Through their emphasis on wisdom, social cohesion, and interrelatedness Faith-Based Organizations can show the potential to not only effectively mobilize people on the ground in responding to climate change but more importantly to motivate large sections of society to move from their deep seeded set of core values.
E05155	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development	in favor of	It is purely economic in nature and encourages excessive production and consumption.
E06009	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	in favor of	The more language communication skills around the closer we can get in this complicated world we live in. The fact it is a popular language around the world but not really recognized in Europe should change. I fully endorse its recognition in Europe.
E06010	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	in favor of	Esperanto is a common language of citizens from all countries of the EU. Esperanto encounters bring them together for contact and understanding. The authorities of the European Union are called upon to support this direct communication of the citizens. It is our free choice in which language we want to talk to each other - please recognize and promote it!  
E06012	We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East	in favor of	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values. They bring crime, terror, and chaos. And after all, if there are no more Europeans in Europe, then what will happen to our beloved continent?
E06016	We should legalize non-violent drug use	in favor of	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!
E06029	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters	against	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.
E06030	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	in favor of	I fully agree that people should not be incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. Drug addiction should be treated as a health issue. Drug addicts need help. Incarceration does not help them.
E06031	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	in favor of	We should legalize drugs as a means to promote justice, harm reduction, and religious freedom.  If we really want justice and human rights, this is absolutely essential.
E06032	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	in favor of	It's also important to remember that many people use these psychedelic medicines in the context of their own religious/spiritual practice, and therefore our draconic laws directly violate freedom of religion (and sovereignty over our own bodies). There's no way the EU should tolerate this if they really care about human rights.
E06033	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	in favor of	Psychedelic medicines specifically have the potential to radically transform our mental health care. 
E06038	We should prevent the surveillance state	in favor of	Excessive surveillance preemptively assumes everyone is a potential criminal and definitely undermines the basic human right of autonomy and self-determination. 
E06039	We should prevent the surveillance state	in favor of	The number of video surveillance and control and intervention rights for public authorities is steadily increasing (at least according to my subjective feeling). This puts our free way of life at risk. A person who feels monitored will never really act freely. 
E06040	We should prevent the surveillance state	in favor of	I am not prepared to continue to restrict my freedom on a permanent basis due to the actions of a minority of offenders, as a citizen who is not a victim. The policy has to find a better balance here. 
E06046	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI	in favor of	In order to be able to fight cross-border crime, Europol should have the same jurisdiction as the FBI in the US. It should focus on domestic EU cross-border crime fighting. It should have the autonomy to act without the intervention of local or national political influence.
E06047	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	in favor of	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.
E06048	We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East	in favor of	Illegal mass migration is a tragedy. Those who organize and direct mass migration are guilty of a crime against Humanity. Soros and Lukashenka are prime examples of such criminals. 
E06049	We should legalize non-violent drug use	in favor of	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.
E06053	We should limit population growth in overcrowded regions	against	Limiting freedom of movement does not seem like a good idea to me. I think what you are experiencing is bad local management, with urban planning laws fast growth and traffic issues can be fixed and avoided altogether.
E06054	We should legalize non-violent drug use	in favor of	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account. A UK study has shown that drugs such as cannabis and many hallucinogenic drugs are far less harmful than alcohol. The study in question was conducted by David J Nutt, Leslie A King, Lawrence D Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs
E06060	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI	against	I think Europol should stay an association of regular National Police Departments and not be turned into anything else. However, I do support the creation of a European Criminal Investigations Office that will have full jurisdiction in the EU to investigate kidnappings and missing persons, cross-border and organized crime, terrorism threats, and digital crimes, and apprehend fugitives and suspects. 
E06067	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life	in favor of	The traditional family is the cornerstone of European civilization. 
E06068	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life	in favor of	The family is people's foundation and it rests on it all their lives and work, and this needs to be valued.
E06070	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines	against	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions.  Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe.  The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable! 
E06083	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters	against	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon!
E07007	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness	in favor of	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.
E07008	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage	against	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.
E07010	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	in favor of	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules.
E07011	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	against	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation.
E07012	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration	in favor of	Protecting the EU's external borders and guaranteeing that no one can enter the Schengen free movement zone who does not have the right to do so is a primary condition for security in Budapest, Berlin, Lyon, or anywhere in Europe.
E07013	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	against	Before Frontex is strengthened, Frontex's human rights violations must first be stopped.
E07015	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	against	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people.  If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society.
E07023	We should remove illegal immigrants.	in favor of	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe. 
E07026	We should protect the European border	in favor of	Only together and with  Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.
E07028	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.  
E07029	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly.  
E07030	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings?
E07031	We should protect the European border.	in favor of	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.
E07066	We should support Frontex.	in favor of	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission. 
E07067	We should support Frontex.	in favor of	 The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.
E07072	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.
E07088	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex). 
E07089	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.
E07093	We should stop integration.	in favor of	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.
E07104	We should punish illegal immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.
E07112	We should protect the European border	in favor of	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years. 
E07115	We should stop immigration.	in favor of	The organization of mass migration is a heinous crime. No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
E07117	We should stop immigration.	in favor of	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa.  Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.
E07124	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work!  What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights
E07144	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.	in favor of	I am concerned about the source of some cotton, which is produced in Chinese detention camps. A unified EU mark of ethical & environmental principles would be a nice thing to have when deciding what to buy.
E07164	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	Unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants have no right to be in the country where they are unauthorized.
E07165	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing. 	against	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.
E07168	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.	in favor of	The vast majority of the victims of this genocide in China are Muslims. And yet, the Muslim countries see the USA and the West as their arch-enemies! 
E07186	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	in favor of	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop the conflict.
E07187	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	in favor of	 Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop immigration.
E07188	We should stop mass migration.	in favor of	Organizing, promoting, directing and financing mass migration is a crime against humanity.
E07201	We should not have illegal immigrants!	in favor of	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields.
E07202	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	in favor of	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.
E07203	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	in favor of	 Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!
E07212	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	Illegal loopholes in the legislation are enabling illegal migration. Family Reunification has been and remains the biggest channel of migration into the EU.
E07213	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	The procedure of Family Reunification is already causing major problems in the USA. 
E07214	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	Family Reunification creates unbearable levels of migration and acute problems of integration for several EU Member States.
E07220	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed.
E07221	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	in favor of	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging.
E07222	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	in favor of	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.
E07231	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	No more immigration from non-European or non-first world countries.
E07234	We should restrict immigration.	in favor of	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.
E07235	We should restrict immigration.	in favor of	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us.
E07256	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality	against	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament. 
E08006	We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users	in favor of	A good idea to end online trolls and haters. Easy to set up, it is a very good short-term solution, but fake news, unfortunately, escapes this regulation. So there is a need for other measures to attack the algorithms of the social networks themselves.
E08007	We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users	in favor of	Anonymity is at least as much as important as Identity.  Today it is very easy to be anonymous, but hard to prove the identity of opinion and establish a public web of trust.  Anonymity enables powerful identities to control the messages, and therefore the identity-seeking masses. 
E08010	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are by far the most important neighbors of the EU. A good relationship with all three is very desirable for the EU. For that, we would have to be willing to understand their history better.
E08011	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions. An understandable reaction to its actions in Ukraine and failing democracy. Let us not forget actions done by others (US intervention in Iraq, the Chinese in Tibet and their treatment of minorities, etc.). Yet we close our eyes.
E08012	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	Russia is troublesome with its own agenda and unconventional methods. Perhaps due to a heritage of a system, that is no longer the norm today. Remember, they fought next to us and Russians merit our hand reaching out to them. A policy change to show empathy, foster closer economic ties, and build on bilateral projects and partnerships in various cultural, scientific, trade, or economic programs. 
E08013	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change. Economic partnerships can act as leverage. Friendly ties, in time, will bring common views to prevail. 
E08014	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).
E08021	We should stop buying Russian gas	in favor of	The Russians use the money we give them in exchange for gas to spread disinformation, and propaganda and finance the terrorists in the Donbas and its mercenaries (Wagner Group) in Libya. 
E08022	We should stop buying Russian gas	in favor of	The cost of gas will be higher. But I prefer to pay a little more for the gas bill than to finance Putin’s malicious activities.
E08024	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU	in favor of	We must support countries that want to improve the welfare and rights of their citizens. If a country wants to join the EU and meets the conditions for joining, the decision to join is solely between the candidate country and the EU.
E08025	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU	in favor of	When you see young Ukrainians dying for the EU and its values during Euromaidan, you have no choice but to accept that Ukraine has chosen Europe. If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. We must deepen our relations with Ukraine and prepare to make it a candidate for membership. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia.
